I recently received the O2 Trainer as a present this past Christmas. 
The idea of this product is to strengthen your diaphragm and lung muscles via resistance as you pull air into your lungs. 
It consists of a mouth piece and interchangeable modules which provide 14 stages of resistance. 
If you visit www.o2trainer.com you find various studies using the product, testimonials and instructions.

My purpose for the product is improving athletic performance. 
I'm currently a blue belt in Kenpo Karate, a style which utilizes quick hand strikes and kicks. 
Sparring can be quite intense and can quickly cause one to run out of breath. 
Tonight I started the first breathing exercise. Starting with module number 11, I did 4 sets of 12 reps. 
One breathes in hard and then exhales. Once I was done and for a few hours after, I could feel that my diagram and abs got a good workout.
I look forward to continued use of this product and effect it has on my performance.
