Hello All and Thank God It's Friday. It's been a very busy week 
and I ready to relax with some fun vids. In view that the release
of Avengers 2 is right around the corner, I think we'll theme this post
with one my favorite Avengers, Thor.

Let's start with a comic book history lesson. It would surprise you to know
that Thor used to have a secret identity.

What's more epic than an epic rap battle? Nothing of course.

If you're like me then sometimes you lay awake at night wondering who would win
in fight; Thor or Superman?

If you're fan of the old Hulk television series, you might be happy to know that 
there was a television movie a few years after the series was cancelled with 
an appearance of Thor. 

Well, that's it for now. Have a good one.
