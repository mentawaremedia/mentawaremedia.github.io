One of my recent reads is the book _'The $100 Startup'_.
It's inspiring and full of great advice 
on starting a business on shoe string budget. The author
has done a great deal of research finding people followed their dreams made
it as well as how they did it.

One of the ideas covered in the book is called _'Convergence'_. This
occurs when a person able to generate income from the thing or things he
is passionate about.

While there are many ways to make money, I would say most would either be boring or
life draining. Being stuck in a job or career that brings you no joy is
just grueling and painful. That's where the daily grind of 8 to 5 will just burn you
out after a few years.

On the other side is being passionate about things which bring you no income. While I may love
walks in the park, I doubt I'll ever make much money at it. 

However, don't be too quick to quit on that crazy idea. It often
just takes a little creativity to pull it off. 
[Bradley "The Rad Brad" Colburn](http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-youtube-stars-2014-3#19-theradbrad-2), for example, 
makes between $137 thousand - $1.38 million dollars a year doing humorous video game 'walkthroughs' on YouTube.

Here are the steps.

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. List out the things you love to do and are passionate about.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Figure out which are likely to make you income.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Do that.

I did something similar in the summer of 1999. After working at several unsatisfying odd jobs
over the years, I realized I needed good income and fulfilling work. I had no formal education but
a lot of interest in various things. I was a good artist but I figured there was no decent income
in that and the demand didn't seem high for it at the time. I did like computers and had above
average knowledge so I thought, "Maybe I'll try that".

I bought various computer science books, studied in the evenings and landed a job in 
tech support about 6 months later. From there, I continued studying, 
was promoted to the software development department. I attended
several classes at a couple of local 2 year colleges.

To this day I continue expanding my skill set, looking at what's in demand and doing that. I've
greatly expanded my income and I love what I do. You can do it too.
