We're going to look at three different
ways of paying off credit cards. Some bad and some good. 
We'll calculate how much you're 
paying on interest and the amount of time it'll take to pay off each card.



|        | Balance | Interest Rate |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Card A | 2,000   |           29% |
| Card B | 2,000   |           15% |
| Card C | 2,000   |           11% |

<br/>  
Above we have three cards setup, each with a balance of 2,000 dollars and interest rates of 
29%, 15% and 11%. We'll assume the minimum monthly payment to be 4% or $15 whichever is
greater.

##The Typical: Paying the minimum.

|        | MONTH 1 PAYMENT | MONTH 6 PAYMENT | MONTH 12 PAYMENT |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Card A |           80.00 |           71.05 |            64.19 |
| Card B |           80.00 |           65.58 |            55.30 | 
| Card C |           80.00 |           64.08 |            52.98 | 
| Total  |          240.00 |          200.71 |           172.47 |

<br/> 
Since the balance of each card drops as payments are made then it's only natural
for the minimum payment due to also drop. If a person is in the habit of paying the 
minimum then his payments will resemble the pattern above. 


|        | MONTHS TO PAY OFF | INTEREST | TOTAL PAID |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Card A |               137 | 2,428.97 |   4,428.97 |
| Card B |                89 |   767.12 |   2,767.12 |
| Card C |                82 |   506.75 |   2,506.75 | 
| Total  |               137 | 3,702.84 |   9,702.84 |       

<br/> 
The above are the results of making minimum payments. It took 137 months or 11 years and 6
months to pay off all this debt. The $6,000 of debt we started with took a total of
$9,702.84 in payments to eliminate; basically adding $3,702.84 of interest payments to the
$6,000 we initially had. That's a lot of money spent on interest.

##Better: Fixed payments.

|        | MONTH 1 PAYMENT | MONTH 6 PAYMENT | MONTH 12 PAYMENT |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Card A |           80.00 |           80.00 |            80.00 |
| Card B |           80.00 |           80.00 |            80.00 |
| Card C |           80.00 |           80.00 |            80.00 |
| Total  |          240.00 |          240.00 |           240.00 |

<br/> 
A better way is to just keep paying our initial minimum payment each month.
This way more and more of our payment will go towards the principal or original
debt. This will accelerate our pay off time.

|        | MONTHS TO PAY OFF | INTEREST | TOTAL PAID |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Card A |                38 |   986.50 |   2,986.50 |
| Card B |                30 |   377.06 |   2,377.06 |
| Card C |                29 |   258.38 |   2,258.38 | 
| Total  |                38 | 1,621.94 |   7,621.94 | 

<br/> 
Applying a fixed payment scheme has saved us a considerable amount of time and money.
It took us only 3 years and 2 months to pay the debt and we saved $2,080.90 in interest. There
is however an even faster way to pay this off using the same total monthly payment amount.

##Best: Adjusting payments.

|        | MONTH 1 PAYMENT | MONTH 6 PAYMENT | MONTH 12 PAYMENT |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Card A |           80.00 |          110.34 |           131.72 |
| Card B |           80.00 |           65.58 |            55.30 | 
| Card C |           80.00 |           64.08 |            52.98 | 
| Total  |          240.00 |          240.00 |           240.00 |

<br/> 
What we're going to do here is focus on making the largest payment on the highest
interest card while paying the minimum on the remainder. If you recall Card A had the highest
interest rate with 29%.

|        | MONTHS TO PAY OFF | INTEREST | TOTAL PAID |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Card A |                22 |   600.85 |   2,600.85 |
| Card B |                28 |   428.39 |   2,428.39 |
| Card C |                32 |   341.44 |   2,341.44 | 
| Total  |                32 | 1,370.68 |   7,621.94 | 

<br/> 
By adjusting our payments we have paid our debt off 6 months faster than the previous 
method and saved an additional $251.26.

To recap, this method of adjusting our payments took us from 137 months to 32 months and
saved us 2,332.16 in interest.

See if you can apply this principle to your finances and you'll free up considerable money
fast.
