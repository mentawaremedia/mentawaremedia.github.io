The Paleo Diet is an effort to eat as our prehistoric ancestors did prior to the 
advent of farming. Food such as meats, fish, nuts, leafy greens, veggies, and seeds
are foods typically found on the diet.

One of the things I believe is missing from the diet is the eating pattern our
ancestors practiced. You see there were typically periods of feast and famine. 
After a successful hunt the group would feast. Then one might expect a certain amount
of time would pass before another successful hunt would take place and thus a
time of fasting would occur.

The dietary practice of intermittent fasting attempts to implement in some form this type of
eating pattern. Generally the diet limits eating to an 8 hour window with a 16 hour 
fast in between.

##Dietary Myths

Martin Berkhan, a nutritional consultant, magazine writer and personal trainer. Is
a strong proponent of this diet and has achieved remarkable results practicing it.
On Martin Berkhan's web site [Lean Gains](http://www.leangains.com/), he goes about
shattering various diet myths.

Some of my favorites are:

###Myth: Eating frequent small meals helps you loose weight

An extenisve review of various meal frequencies and its effect on metabolism
showed no effect between eating several small meals or a couple of large ones.

To quote the review, ["More importantly, studies using 
whole-body calorimetry and doubly-labelled water to assess total 24 h 
energy expenditure find __no difference between nibbling and gorging.__"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494)

###Myth: Eat smaller meals more often for hunger control.

Current research suggests the opposite. Eating more often leads to increased 
hunger.

["Collectively, these data suggest that higher protein 
intake promotes satiety and challenge the concept that 
increasing the number of eating occasions enhances satiety 
in overweight and obese men"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20339363)

##Examples

The following are some examples of the form this pattern of feeding and exercise would
look like:

####Pattern 1
* Fasting - Fast from 8 p.m. the night before till 10 -11 a.m. or so and take 10g BCAAs.
* Train - Hot the gym and get your workout in.
* Meal One – 1 p.m.
* Meal Two – 4 p.m.
* Meal Three – 7 p.m.

####Pattern 2
* Pre-Workout Meal - 12 Noon.
* Train
* Meal Two – 4 p.m.
* Meal Three – 7/8 p.m.

####Pattern 3
* Meal One – Noon.
* Meal Two – 3 p.m.
* Train
* Meal Three – 7/8 p.m.

Martin Berkhan claims many benefits to this type of dieting such as weight loss,
better hormonal response and improved blood sugar levels. He cites various
scientific studies and testimonials from his clients.
