You probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-takin' business; 
we in the killin' Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin'.
{% endblockquote %}

Ok so I've played the role of a grammar Nazi and I've been at the receiving end 
as well. I think we all pretty much have. So I cannot claim to be purely on one side of 
this arguement. 

However the scenario I'm addressing here is everyday speech. See if this sounds familiar.
You're having a discussion with someone and the grammar Nazi all of a sudden objects
to something you've said. As if you've offened his mother he says, "No, that's not
correct. There is no such word as that." or he'll say, "You're using that incorrectly."

Since then, I've been doing a bit of reading and research to maybe help the Allies of
Bad Grammar to justify the way we speak. Now, I'm no Shakespeare. I don't have a degree in 
English. But that doesn't prevent me from having an informed opinion
on the subject.

In my specific case it was the use of the word 'irregardless'. I know, scandalous. 
The Nazi says, "There is no such word as 'irregardless'". I could practically hear a 
heavy German accent behind his objections. I was of course unprepared to defend my
position on the use of such a word. I mean no one said there would be a test on grammar. 
And the grammar Nazi, speaking with such an authortative tone, must be correct. 

First off, arguing that a word doesn't 'exist' is a flawed premis. Why? Because anyone 
could pretty much make up a word and it would 'exist'.

French Roman Catholic archbishop, theologian, poet and writer François Fénelon best
describes this process of word creation in the following quote.

{% blockquote François Fénelon, 'Letter to the French Academy' (translation) 1714 %}
We lack a term; we feel the need of one. Choose a pleasant sound, 
with no trace of ambiguity about it, which adapts itself to our 
language, and which is an easy way of making our speech more concise. 
Each individual first of all sees an opportunity for it; four or five 
people risk using it unassumingly in informal conversation; others 
repeat it because of its taste of novelty; and there it is in fashion. 
In this way a footpath newly begun across a field soon becomes the 
most well-trodden, when the old road is found to be uneven and not so short.
{% endblockquote %}

The fact is that different regions, professions, peoples and groups each have a certain
amount of unique vocabulary, pronunciation and idoms. Vocabulary is also an ever expanding 
landscape, not a static and fixed thing.<sub>1</sub>


[That word doesn't exist]
[You cannot use bad grammar]
[Rules for the sake of Rules]
[The logistics of correcting grammar]

  It tends to interrupt thought flow to bring grammar into conversation unless 
  asked to do.

[The etiqutte of correcting grammar]

{% blockquote  John Bridges & Bryan Curtis, As a Gentleman Would Say: Responses to Life's Important (and Sometimes Awkward) Situations %}
Unless he is teaching an English class,
a gentleman does not corrects another person's grammar.
{% endblockquote %}

Non-native speakers will often make errors
