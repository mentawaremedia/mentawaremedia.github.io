Hello all. Thanks for coming by for TGIF 4. It's been another week and time 
to end it with some vids. The theme this week is touchingly sweet videos that
will probably give you cavities. Hope you enjoy.

but she thought she kept hearing them outside. So we sang to keep her mind preoccupied. 
In the end, nothing competes with fireworks."

This is an incredible and short documentary covering an orchestra using instruments made
from trash found at the dump. A wonderful story about ingenuity.

This is an inspiring story about an unlikely child soccer team which persevered despite many
obstacles.

While this is only a car commercial, I found the overall message very powerful and words
to live by.
