Ganache is a chocolate mixture used in several deserts. Warm ganache can be lightly poured on cake to create a glaze or it can be used as filling in cakes such as a molten lava cake. It can also drizzled on ice cream as tasty topping. Cold ganache can be rolled into chocolate truffles. 

My current favorite low carb sweetener I use in cooking is Sin-Free Sugar. It has a flavor very close to sugar, is all natural and calorie free. I prefer it to Truvia for various reasons. Truvia consists of erythritol, stevia and natural flavors. I notice when using Truvia in recipes that require a lot sweetener that it tends to become gritty upon cooling. I donâ€™t run into this issue with Sin-Free since it consists of a blend of natural sugars your body does not absorb. For more information you can check out the Sin-Free Sugar website: https://www.sinfreesugar.com/ .

The mixture will thicken to harden in the fridge. You can gently melt some in the microwave when you want to use it on your low carb deserts or you an add some to your coffee with a bit of cream for a real tasty coffee mocha.

The recipes yields about 29 oz with under 1 net carb for 2 oz serving.

Ingredients 

8 oz unsweetened chocolate 
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups of Sin-Free Sugar
2 tablespoons SweetLeaf
4 tablespoons salted butter

Steps:

Chop unsweetened chocolate and butter, place into a mixing bowl.

Mix dry ingredients together (Sin-Free Sugar, SweetLeaf) and place into a medium saucepan.

Add wet ingredients (heavy cream, vanilla) to saucepan, Stir until dry and wet ingredients are mixed well so that no large lumps are present.

Heat the mixture while stirring. When mixture bubbles and begins to climb the sides of the saucepan, turn off stove and remove from heat.

Add hot mixture to mixing bowl containing chocolate pieces and wait 1 minute.

Stir mixture in bowl until all chocolate is melted and well incorporated.

Whisk until smooth and slightly thickened.

Leave until a bit cooled and then move to a container and store in refrigerator.
