I was going to name this article, "Algebra for everyday problem solving," but
I was concerned many people would assume this had to do with figuring out the
speed of a train having left the station two hours ago. Well, that's not what this
all about. Instead it's much more interesting.

Lets look at some basic algebra and then I'll elaborate.

``` ruby
10 + x = 12

therefore

10 + 2 = 12
```

If we look at the problem on line 1 above, we see that at first we don't know what 'x' is.
What we do know is that 10 plus that value will yield us 12. So it's very easy to then determine
that 'x' is in fact equal to '2'. So what just happened here?

What happened is that we had an unknown (x), two knowns (10 and 12) and an
established relationship between them and from that we were able to determine the unknown.

##The Confusion

A confusion is often made of several unknown factors. The more unknowns the more
confusing the situation can be. Likewise, the more knowns there are the less confusion
there is. This then can aid us in gaining a foothold into the resolution problems.

One must operate from those elements which have the highest degree of certainty and 
truth. From that solid foundation we attempt to solve one of the unkowns, then another and 
another until all elements are solved.

For example, the police find a dead body? Who is it? How did he die? When? Was it murder? 
Who killed him? There are many unknowns. They run his fingerprints and find out who he is.
They take the body to the coroner and get the time of death and probable cause of death. 
Now they know it was Joe Burns, he died 48 hours ago and he was struck with a bat 
which caused the death. They now have some nice solid knowns to operate from from.

Since they know he died 48 hours ago, they canvas the area looking for witnesses present
around that time. They can also use the time of death to eliminate suspects by 
verifying alibis. They can look for a particular murder weapon. 
With his ID, they can find his friends and family and ascertain possible
suspects. 

Thus the police can begin to solve this mystery from building more and more knowns from
a declining number unknowns. 

##Look Out for...

One tries to operate from highest known one can achieve. This does not mean the
'known' is necessarily correct; it's just the most correct datum we have
available. For example in our crime drama, it's possible the
body may have been affected by some process which caused an incorrect conclusion as to
the time of death. Thus shifting the time line of events. 

Occam's razor is very often misstated as the simplest answer is usually the correct
one. This is quite an incorrect statement. Actually, the principle states that the answer
with the least number of assumptions is the correct one. Complexity is not the issue, 
assumptions are the problem. 

So, beware of operating off of assumptions and here-say. The best thing is as direct an observation
as one can obtain. In solving issues at work, solutions have often been delayed by just taking
a coworkers word for it. This is not to say people are not truthful it's just that
we often have issues recalling things accurately or we might miscommunicate what we have
observed.

Play a game of telephone sometime with a group of friends and you'll be amazed how easily
facts are distorted within a few retellings.

Well, I hope this has been of value.

Take Care.
