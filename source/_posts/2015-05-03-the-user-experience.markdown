{% blockquote JAKOB NIELSEN and DON NORMAN %}

"User experience" encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction 
with the company, its services, and its products.

Over the last couple of the months the company where I am currently employed has
sponsored company wide UX training through the Nielsen Norman Group(NN/g). I also 
passed the examinations and I am now UX 
Certified([UXC#1007600](http://www.nngroup.com/ux-certification#track. ))

NN/g is at the fore front of evidence based User Experience research. As a software
developer, I found it very sobering that what I and my other fellow coworkers
were building may not be all that comprehensible to the end user of the systems we
engineered. However, this problem was not unique to us. In fact companies such
as Pizza Hut, Amazon, Chipotle and others struggle with it all the time.

Anytime a user experiences frustration or confusion using or ordering a product,
you run a high probability of never seeing them again. We don't set out to build
products that are difficult to use. We want our customers to experience success 
and return to us with future business again and again.

Unfortunately the individuals building a product are too close to and too familiar 
with the product to realize the difficulties apparent in its use. A creator will
place controls in a certain order and position. Since he has spent so much time
crafting and wiring those controls; what they do will be second nature to him. He
could very well know what each does with no need of labels or cues. However, 
another may find these controls counter intuitive and confusing. The order of things
makes no sense and they do not do what he expects.

Another issue is creator pride which blinds us to the faults present. There are
times when we might create something like a piece of art, a dish to eat or another 
creation. As the creator we might be blind to poor composition of the art work or the 
lack of flavor in a meal which is so apparent to another.

For this reason its important to validate what we build. We must seek out the 
brutally honest opinion of the end consumer, of the end user. Does he enjoy using
the product? Does he find it confusing? The way these sort of tests
are conducted so as to obtain statistically valid and actionable results without
influencing the subject is at the core of NN/g training.

Lets view a couple of videos.

The Ring was a Kickstarter funded project with great promises to control all sorts
of other electronic devices through various hand gestures. The reviewer really digs 
into them hard for what he perceived as an incredibly poor user experience. He
found the product difficult to use, failing incredibly in delivering its promise.

Takuro Yoshida, the Ring creator, responded to the harsh reviews of his 
[product](https://www.techinasia.com/ring-kickstarter-wearable-ceo-responds-to-criticism/).
From the interview, it does appear that there is a user experience disconnect at the
very least with a portion of Ring users. If you read the interview you'll notice this
statement by the interviewer.

{% blockquote %}
Yoshida passed me his ring and I was able to learn six gestures in a matter of minutes. Without his instruction, I probably wouldnâ€™t have realized that I was flicking my wrist too much (you should only move your finger) or moving too much after completing a gesture (you have to hold still for a moment for the gesture to register).
{% endblockquote %}

This seems to indicate that indeed the product is just not that intuitive to
some people. I hope the company manages to address these issues whether actual
or just perceived. I can see how the idea of controlling your electronics 
through hand gestures can be very appealing.

Well, I hope you've enjoyed this. Till next time.
