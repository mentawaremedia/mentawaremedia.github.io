Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to remind 
myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's all. Their 
feathers are just too bright and when they fly away, the part 
of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice...but still, 
the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

There are times when you miss a fomer coworker. Maybe they were really good at what
they did. Perhaps they were clever, upbeat or eccentric. Or maybe they offered much
needed comic relief. 

A couple of months ago one of my coworkers decided to take a couple years off from work to
strike it on his own to build a product he's passionate about without the
daily pressures of a job.

He's a young guy with his own offbeat sense of humor. Those of us that worked with him 
found him quite hilarious.

I don't know what inspired me to do this but I drew a caricature of him on dry erase 
painted wall of our office and I every so often I update the captions on it. People read
it have a good laugh and it's almost like he never left.

Now, this coworker is a young guy just a few years out of college. He is an atheist who
seems to disappear into his room for days according to his roommate. He loves to play 
video games downing a six pack of Monster Energy drinks and a family size bag of Skittles...
ok, I made up that last bit.

I theorize that he must be keeping a joural of all the wrongs inflicted on him by the
world yet I have absolutely no proof whatsoever. He apparently is not compelled to give
Christmas presents to his family yet for some strange reason has no problem accepting
them.
