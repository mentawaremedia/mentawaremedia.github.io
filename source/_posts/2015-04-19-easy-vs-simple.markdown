The meaning of words naturally evolve over time. As a consequence certain words 
will unfortunately lose their distinctive meaning and become an undistinguished 
synonym for another word. This is what I believe has happened with the words
'easy' and 'simple' which are now used quite interchangeablely. The original 
meaning of these words can help us illustrate a very important idea. 


We'll start by looking at their definitions.

##Definitions

{% blockquote Macmillian Dictionary for Students %}

easy - requiring little effort; presenting few difficulties; not difficult.

simple - easily done, used, or understood.

{% endblockquote %}

As you can see these words are very close in meaning today. Let's take a look
at what they used to mean.

##Origins

'Easy' originally came from the Latin word ADJACERE which means to lie near. This
makes sense as those things which lie near physically or mentally are easy to 
reach. 

'Simple' comes for the Latin word SIMPLEX which means single fold. In other words
something is simple when it consists of very few parts. Thus when something
has little in the way of parts it then is not a difficult thing to grasp.

##Observations

I'd like to point out the origin of 'easy' implies a certain subjectivity. As
things which are easy for me (near my mind) ,due to my experience, may not
be easy for someone else. In contrast 'simple' is more objective. The more parts
and more intertwined and dependent those parts are of a thing, the less simple 
that thing is.

For example Spanish is a simple language, Grammatically, it has fewer 
irregularities than other romance languages. This would be an objective 
statement. 

However Spanish is easy for me since it's my first language and
difficult for my wife since she does not speak it. Thus we see easy 
take on a more subjective role.

##Okay, so what?

We are obsessed with the easy at the cost of complexity.The benefits or 
detriments can be argued but it is none the less there. It is easy (close, near) 
to go to the market and purchase a carton of orange juice but have you ever 
wondered how complex (many parts) it was to produce that carton and it's contents?

It's far easier to use power windows but the mechanism has many parts and with
many parts comes the probability that something will go wrong sooner than a simpler
mechanism,  requiring service. It can be easy to ship a package but not so simple to find 
one lost in the labyrinth it traveled.

Cheating, stealing and lying are all easy. We gain what we desire immediately.
The consequence is complexity. Keeping track of the lies told, avoiding discovery,
and having people distrust and hate us does not a simple life make.

This trade off between easy and simple is especially of concern to those who
build things such as engineers. Some select at tool or technique because
of it's ease of use yet it may actually lead to a complex structure which is
difficult to maintain and service.

Keep this in mind when doing something because it's easy.
