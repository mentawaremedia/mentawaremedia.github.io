Before going low carb, I used to enjoy the occasional bowl of oatmeal. 
Depending on the type of low carb diet you practice and how strict 
the amount of carbs are, it may not be a choice. A typical serving 
comes in at 20 plus or so net carbs. This prompted me to take a look 
around the inter webs and look some low carb alternatives.

This first recipe uses chai seeds, flax meal, shredded unsweetened 
coconut and cinnamon. Add some hot water, a bit of unsweetened 
coconut milk, sweetener  and you might have a [winner](http://holisticallyengineered.com/2013/05/instant-cinnamon-oatmeal-low-carb.html).

This next recipe is called ‘Overnight Flaxmeal’. 
It incorporates yogurt, flaxseed meal, unsweetened almond milk, 
protein powder, sweetener and raspberries. 
It’s a simple recipe and the 
[instructions](http://the-lowcarb-diet.com/low-carb-overnight-flax-meal) 
are pretty straight forward.

Another showing some promise is ‘Coconut Breakfast Porridge’. 
[This recipe](http://freshfitnhealthy.com/2014/04/coconut-breakfast-porridge-low-carb-oatmeal) uses unsweetened shredded coconut,  unsweetened 
vanilla almond milk, Coconut Flour.

This [one](http://delishix.com/noatmeal-no-oatmeal-recipe) is a 
bit trickier since you have to grind up various nuts 
in a food processor and you’ll have to incorporate eggs into as well. 
The ingredients in this recipe are walnuts, pecans, almonds, pepitas, 
flax meal, cinnamon, almond butter, eggs, sweetener.

This final one is very simple straightforward 
[recipe](http://www.foodiefiasco.com/low-carb-coconut-oatmeal) 
with minimal ingredient. The items needed are coconut, 
coconut milk, water and coconut flour.
