The following are some ideas regarding social economic classes and spending patterns 
introduced in various books such as _Rich Dad Poor Dad_.


{% img center /images/poor_a.jpg 600 %} 

Here we see the typical young person or the poor. The income on the left
being consumed almost completely by basic recurring expenses. 
The net or left over income is very little.

As the individual begins to earn more income his economic status improves and
his net income grows since he is now outpacing his recurring expenses. Life is
good, he can afford things he could not before. He can now qualify for credit
and loans given this higher income bracket. However, he then falls into the trap
middle class america falls into...debt.

He begins to engage in financial commitments that generate a 
recurring bill such as buying a home, leasing a car, loans, credit card 
purchases, etc.

These long term commitments now generate a recurring bill which consumes his
monthly net income, lowering its margin and causing him to be broke...again.

I hate to use the term "rich" because it's a little banal and sometimes not 
accurate of this class of individual. Let's just call him the 'well off'. This is one prudent strategy 
to build solvency and build economic independence.

Here the person, instead of investing in future financial commitments, tackles
existing commitment to pay them down or off and then invests in income generating
assets. Preferably assets that passively generate income. In other words assets that
will generate income and not consume much of his time. Things like royality rights,
stocks, bonds, intellectual property, real estate and such.

By doing this he now lowers his recurring debt increasing his net income. Also he
begins earning money passively thus boosting his current income. 

I hope this might be useful to some you.
