One of the things I'm finding pretty fun these last few fridays is
watching some good youtube vids. I have a pretty eclectic taste so I think
you might find some of these interesting to you.
What I'd like to shoot for is sharing some of the more interesting
videos every Friday.

If you're like me and love the Lord of the Rings films but don't have the patience to slug 
through hundreds of pages of fiction then this video is for you. It gives you a nice
background on the mythos of the LOTR universe.

Speaking of LOTR, have you watched the trilogy only to ask yourself, "...So what does the One Ring 
do again?". Well then this video is just for you.

Want a theory for the existence of the Hulk? Kyle Hill takes a stab at the question
with some science. Oh yeah!

If you're a big ol' comic book geek like me then you're loving all the little bits of news
trickling in about the upcoming Deadpool movie.
