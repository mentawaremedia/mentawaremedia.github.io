Some months ago I came across a list of top books recommended by
successful entrepreneurs. Towards the top of this list was the 
book 'The Lean Startup'. I highly recommend this book to anyone
looking to start their own business or anyone involved in management.

One of the major concepts in the lean startup method is what's referred to
as the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. The basic idea is a cycle of
of building a product, measuring success then learning from this measurement
and other actions so as to build a better product and finally start
the cycle again. It is a way managing uncertainty and risk.

Realize that it's the speed at which this cycle occurs that most likely 
determines success. A startup or new venture has a limited amount of time
and/or funds in order to become a viable concern. Once these resources are
consumed and no other options are present; the startup is done. This is why 
speed is of essence.

While the cycle seems straight forward, each of these points on the cycle 
has it's challenges.

##Build

The Lean Startup has the concept of a Minimal Viable Product or MVP.
The idea is that you never build more than what is needed to learn.
While we would all love to produce a beautiful finished and polished 
piece of work, it comes at a price. The price is time and waste.

What benefit is it to create a 'wonderful' product that no one will ever buy? 
The end result is a tremendous investment in time with the end result of 
learning that no one wants it. One could have learned this in a fraction
of the time and expense with an MVP.

##Measure

Learn to measure and track meaningful things that will guide you in determining
if your product is proving successful. The book covers in detail the difference
between actionable metrics and vanity metrics. In order for a metric to be
actionable it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Otherwise the metric
could lead you astray giving you a false sense of security.

##Learn

Are you taking what you've learned from your metrics to build an even better 
product or are you randomly dropping in product features and strategies simply 
because it 'feels right' or it sounds like a 'good idea'? At what point do
you make a fundamental change to your business based on the learning done
so far? What have we learned and what are we doing about it?

I hope you enjoyed this little article. 

The last couple of weeks I've been sticking to a pattern that has worked well
for me for releasing new blog content. On Mondays I'll post an article on self 
improvement or health related topic. Wednesday I'll release an article for 
folks doing software development and Fridays I'll close out the week with 
something fun such as some interesting Youtube videos. Thanks to all my
return visitors. I hope you come back soon.
