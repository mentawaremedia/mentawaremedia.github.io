How you get to know is what I want to know.
{% endblockquote %}

The world is full of opportunitie. There are all sorts wonderful problems surrounding us. How 
can I loose weight? Can I learn faster? How can I be more successful? 

By understanding the world around us we're better able to the steer our lives and 
accomplish our goals. Knowledge empowers us. It shines a light onto the darkness
of ignorance and superstition.

###Who am I?

I'm a software developer. I started out my career in technical support in the
late 90's. In 2000 I started doing software development using Visual Basic 6 
followed by desktop application development using Microsoft Visual Studio. At 
that time I became a bit obsessed with certifications and achieved several
such as a A+, Network+, MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional), 
CCA (Citrix Certified Administrator), CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate).
In 2008 I began writing web applications using the popular open source framework 
Ruby on Rails. Rails has become my preferred tool to
build web sites and backend systems.

I'm an artist. I've been doing artwork off and on since I was in elementary school.
For a brief period in 2013, I had the opportunity to produce artwork professionally
by creating cover art for self published ebook authors.

I practice martial arts. Since 2013 I've been taking martial arts lessons in Kenpo
Karate. It's an art that prides itself in practicality in self defense. It constantly improves 
it's techniques and application. In Kenpo we have a saying, "If it works, then it's Kenpo".

I'm also very curious about the world around me, improving myself, and doing a better job
at pretty much anything I can lay my hands on.

Feel free to contact me with suggestions, ideas or questions.
