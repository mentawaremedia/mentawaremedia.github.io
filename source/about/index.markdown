_'How you get to know is what I want to know.' - Richard Feynman_


The world is full of opportunities. There are all sorts wonderful problems surrounding us. How 
can I loose weight? Can I learn faster? How can I be more successful? 

By understanding the world around us we're better able to the steer our lives and 
accomplish our goals. Knowledge empowers us. It shines a light onto the darkness
of ignorance and superstition.

Who am I? I'm a software developer and artist. 
I also enjoy writing, practicing martial arts, working out 
and general learning.
