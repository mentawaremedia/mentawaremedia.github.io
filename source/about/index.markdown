{% blockquote Richard Feynman, The Meaning of It All %}
How you get to know is what I want to know.
{% endblockquote %}

The world is full of opportunities. There are all sorts wonderful problems surrounding us. How 
can I loose weight? Can I learn faster? How can I be more successful? 

By understanding the world around us we're better able to the steer our lives and 
accomplish our goals. Knowledge empowers us. It shines a light onto the darkness
of ignorance and superstition.

###Who am I?

I'm a software developer with over 15 years experience. 
I started out my career in technical support; I quickly
moved on to writing enterprise desktop applications.
Then in 2008 I began writing web applications using the popular 
open source framework Ruby on Rails. 

I'm an artist. I've been doing artwork off and on since I was in elementary school.
Occasionally I produce artwork professionally
licensing custom cover artwork for self published ebook authors.

I practice martial arts. I practice Kenpo
Karate. It's an art that prides itself in practicality in self defense. 

I'm also very curious about the world around me, improving myself, and doing a better job
at pretty much anything I can lay my hands on.

Feel free to contact me with suggestions, ideas or questions.

Currently my efforts are geared toward publishing some material under the brand of **Mentaware Media**.
