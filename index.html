<p><img class="left" src="/images/creditcards.jpg" width="250"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to look at three different
ways of paying off credit cards. Some bad and some good.
We&rsquo;ll calculate how much you&rsquo;re
paying on interest and the amount of time it&rsquo;ll take to pay off each card.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> Balance </th>
<th> Interest Rate </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td> 2,000   </td>
<td>           29% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td> 2,000   </td>
<td>           15% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td> 2,000   </td>
<td>           11% </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/><br/>
Above we have three cards setup, each with a balance of 2,000 dollars and interest rates of
29%, 15% and 11%. We&rsquo;ll assume the minimum monthly payment to be 4% or $15 whichever is
greater.</p>

<h2>The Typical: Paying the minimum.</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTH 1 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 6 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 12 PAYMENT </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           71.05 </td>
<td>            64.19 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           65.58 </td>
<td>            55.30 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           64.08 </td>
<td>            52.98 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>          200.71 </td>
<td>           172.47 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
Since the balance of each card drops as payments are made then it&rsquo;s only natural
for the minimum payment due to also drop. If a person is in the habit of paying the
minimum then his payments will resemble the pattern above.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTHS TO PAY OFF </th>
<th> INTEREST </th>
<th> TOTAL PAID </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>               137 </td>
<td> 2,428.97 </td>
<td>   4,428.97 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>                89 </td>
<td>   767.12 </td>
<td>   2,767.12 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>                82 </td>
<td>   506.75 </td>
<td>   2,506.75 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>               137 </td>
<td> 3,702.84 </td>
<td>   9,702.84 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
The above are the results of making minimum payments. It took 137 months or 11 years and 6
months to pay off all this debt. The $6,000 of debt we started with took a total of
$9,702.84 in payments to eliminate; basically adding $3,702.84 of interest payments to the
$6,000 we initially had. That&rsquo;s a lot of money spent on interest.</p>

<h2>Better: Fixed payments.</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTH 1 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 6 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 12 PAYMENT </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>            80.00 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>            80.00 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>            80.00 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>           240.00 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
A better way is to just keep paying our initial minimum payment each month.
This way more and more of our payment will go towards the principal or original
debt. This will accelerate our pay off time.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTHS TO PAY OFF </th>
<th> INTEREST </th>
<th> TOTAL PAID </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>                38 </td>
<td>   986.50 </td>
<td>   2,986.50 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>                30 </td>
<td>   377.06 </td>
<td>   2,377.06 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>                29 </td>
<td>   258.38 </td>
<td>   2,258.38 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>                38 </td>
<td> 1,621.94 </td>
<td>   7,621.94 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
Applying a fixed payment scheme has saved us a considerable amount of time and money.
It took us only 3 years and 2 months to pay the debt and we saved $2,080.90 in interest. There
is however an even faster way to pay this off using the same total monthly payment amount.</p>

<h2>Best: Adjusting payments.</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTH 1 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 6 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 12 PAYMENT </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>          110.34 </td>
<td>           131.72 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           65.58 </td>
<td>            55.30 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           64.08 </td>
<td>            52.98 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>           240.00 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
What we&rsquo;re going to do here is focus on making the largest payment on the highest
interest card while paying the minimum on the remainder. If you recall Card A had the highest
interest rate with 29%.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTHS TO PAY OFF </th>
<th> INTEREST </th>
<th> TOTAL PAID </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>                22 </td>
<td>   600.85 </td>
<td>   2,600.85 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>                28 </td>
<td>   428.39 </td>
<td>   2,428.39 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>                32 </td>
<td>   341.44 </td>
<td>   2,341.44 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>                32 </td>
<td> 1,370.68 </td>
<td>   7,621.94 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
By adjusting our payments we have paid our debt off 6 months faster than the previous
method and saved an additional $251.26.</p>

<p>To recap, this method of adjusting our payments took us from 137 months to 32 months and
saved us 2,332.16 in interest.</p>

<p>See if you can apply this principle to your finances and you&rsquo;ll free up considerable money
fast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following are some ideas regarding social economic classes and spending patterns
introduced in various books such as <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/poor_a.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Here we see the typical young person or the poor. The income on the left
being consumed almost completely by basic recurring expenses.
The net or left over income is very little.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_a.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>As the individual begins to earn more income his economic status improves and
his net income grows since he is now outpacing his recurring expenses. Life is
good, he can afford things he could not before. He can now qualify for credit
and loans given this higher income bracket. However, he then falls into the trap
middle class america falls into&hellip;debt.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_b.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>He begins to engage in financial commitments that generate a
recurring bill such as buying a home, leasing a car, loans, credit card
purchases, etc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_c.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>These long term commitments now generate a recurring bill which consumes his
monthly net income, lowering its margin and causing him to be broke&hellip;again.</p>

<p>I hate to use the term &ldquo;rich&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a little banal and sometimes not
accurate of this class of individual. Let&rsquo;s just call him the &lsquo;well off&rsquo;. This is one prudent strategy
to build solvency and build economic independence.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_to_rich_b.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Here the person, instead of investing in future financial commitments, tackles
existing commitment to pay them down or off and then invests in income generating
assets. Preferably assets that passively generate income. In other words assets that
will generate income and not consume much of his time. Things like royality rights,
stocks, bonds, intellectual property, real estate and such.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_to_rich_c.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>By doing this he now lowers his recurring debt increasing his net income. Also he
begins earning money passively thus boosting his current income.</p>

<p>I hope this might be useful to some you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Once you have to start counting calories, <br/>it takes away from the joy of eating.</p><footer><strong>Mireille Guiliano</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>The Paleo Diet is an effort to eat as our prehistoric ancestors did prior to the
advent of farming. Food such as meats, fish, nuts, leafy greens, veggies, and seeds
are foods typically found on the diet.</p>

<p>One of the things I believe is missing from the diet is the eating pattern our
ancestors practiced. You see there were typically periods of feast and famine.
After a successful hunt the group would feast. Then one might expect a certain amount
of time would pass before another successful hunt would take place and thus a
time of fasting would occur.</p>

<p>The dietary practice of intermittent fasting attempts to implement in some form this type of
eating pattern. Generally the diet limits eating to an 8 hour window with a 16 hour
fast in between.</p>

<h2>Dietary Myths</h2>

<p>Martin Berkhan, a nutritional consultant, magazine writer and personal trainer. Is
a strong proponent of this diet and has achieved remarkable results practicing it.
On Martin Berkhan&rsquo;s web site <a href="http://www.leangains.com/">Lean Gains</a>, he goes about
shattering various diet myths.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites are:</p>

<h3>Myth: Eating frequent small meals helps you loose weight</h3>

<p>An extenisve review of various meal frequencies and its effect on metabolism
showed no effect between eating several small meals or a couple of large ones.</p>

<p>To quote the review, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494">&ldquo;More importantly, studies using
whole-body calorimetry and doubly-labelled water to assess total 24 h
energy expenditure find <strong>no difference between nibbling and gorging.</strong>&rdquo;</a></p>

<h3>Myth: Eat smaller meals more often for hunger control.</h3>

<p>Current research suggests the opposite. Eating more often leads to increased
hunger.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20339363">&ldquo;Collectively, these data suggest that higher protein
intake promotes satiety and challenge the concept that
increasing the number of eating occasions enhances satiety
in overweight and obese men&rdquo;</a></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The following are some examples of the form this pattern of feeding and exercise would
look like:</p>

<h4>Pattern 1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fasting - Fast from 8 p.m. the night before till 10 -11 a.m. or so and take 10g BCAAs.</li>
<li>Train - Hot the gym and get your workout in.</li>
<li>Meal One – 1 p.m.</li>
<li>Meal Two – 4 p.m.</li>
<li>Meal Three – 7 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pattern 2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pre-Workout Meal - 12 Noon.</li>
<li>Train</li>
<li>Meal Two – 4 p.m.</li>
<li>Meal Three – 7/8 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pattern 3</h4>

<ul>
<li>Meal One – Noon.</li>
<li>Meal Two – 3 p.m.</li>
<li>Train</li>
<li>Meal Three – 7/8 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<p>Martin Berkhan claims many benefits to this type of dieting such as weight loss,
better hormonal response and improved blood sugar levels. He cites various
scientific studies and testimonials from his clients.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.</p><footer><strong>Confucius</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>One of my recent reads is the book <em>&lsquo;The $100 Startup&rsquo;</em>.
It&rsquo;s inspiring and full of great advice
on starting a business on shoe string budget. The author
has done a great deal of research finding people followed their dreams made
it as well as how they did it.</p>

<p>One of the ideas covered in the book is called <em>&lsquo;Convergence&rsquo;</em>. This
occurs when a person able to generate income from the thing or things he
is passionate about.</p>

<p>While there are many ways to make money, I would say most would either be boring or
life draining. Being stuck in a job or career that brings you no joy is
just grueling and painful. That&rsquo;s where the daily grind of 8 to 5 will just burn you
out after a few years.</p>

<p>On the other side is being passionate about things which bring you no income. While I may love
walks in the park, I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever make much money at it.</p>

<p>However, don&rsquo;t be too quick to quit on that crazy idea. It often
just takes a little creativity to pull it off.
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-youtube-stars-2014-3#19-theradbrad-2">Bradley &ldquo;The Rad Brad&rdquo; Colburn</a>, for example,
makes between $137 thousand - $1.38 million dollars a year doing humorous video game &lsquo;walkthroughs&rsquo; on YouTube.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/convergence.jpg" width="592" height="420"></p>

<p>Here are the steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. List out the things you love to do and are passionate about.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Figure out which are likely to make you income.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Do that.</p>

<p>I did something similar in the summer of 1999. After working at several unsatisfying odd jobs
over the years, I realized I needed good income and fulfilling work. I had no formal education but
a lot of interest in various things. I was a good artist but I figured there was no decent income
in that and the demand didn&rsquo;t seem high for it at the time. I did like computers and had above
average knowledge so I thought, &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll try that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I bought various computer science books, studied in the evenings and landed a job in
tech support about 6 months later. From there, I continued studying,
was promoted to the software development department. I attended
several classes at a couple of local 2 year colleges.</p>

<p>To this day I continue expanding my skill set, looking at what&rsquo;s in demand and doing that. I&rsquo;ve
greatly expanded my income and I love what I do. You can do it too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before going low carb, I used to enjoy the occasional bowl of oatmeal.
Depending on the type of low carb diet you practice and how strict
the amount of carbs are, it may not be a choice. A typical serving
comes in at 20 plus or so net carbs. This prompted me to take a look
around the inter webs and look some low carb alternatives.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/Grain-Free-Instant-Cinnamon-Oatmeal.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>This first recipe uses chai seeds, flax meal, shredded unsweetened
coconut and cinnamon. Add some hot water, a bit of unsweetened
coconut milk, sweetener  and you might have a <a href="http://holisticallyengineered.com/2013/05/instant-cinnamon-oatmeal-low-carb.html">winner</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/low-carb-overnight-flax-meal-1-704x1024.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>This next recipe is called ‘Overnight Flaxmeal’.
It incorporates yogurt, flaxseed meal, unsweetened almond milk,
protein powder, sweetener and raspberries.
It’s a simple recipe and the
<a href="http://the-lowcarb-diet.com/low-carb-overnight-flax-meal">instructions</a>
are pretty straight forward.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/coconut_oatmeal.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Another showing some promise is ‘Coconut Breakfast Porridge’.
<a href="http://freshfitnhealthy.com/2014/04/coconut-breakfast-porridge-low-carb-oatmeal">This recipe</a> uses unsweetened shredded coconut,  unsweetened
vanilla almond milk, Coconut Flour.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/noatmeal-finished.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>This <a href="http://delishix.com/noatmeal-no-oatmeal-recipe">one</a> is a
bit trickier since you have to grind up various nuts
in a food processor and you’ll have to incorporate eggs into as well.
The ingredients in this recipe are walnuts, pecans, almonds, pepitas,
flax meal, cinnamon, almond butter, eggs, sweetener.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/low_carb_coconut_oatmeal.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>This final one is very simple straightforward
<a href="http://www.foodiefiasco.com/low-carb-coconut-oatmeal">recipe</a>
with minimal ingredient. The items needed are coconut,
coconut milk, water and coconut flour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ganache is a chocolate mixture used in several deserts. Warm ganache can be lightly poured on cake to create a glaze or it can be used as filling in cakes such as a molten lava cake. It can also drizzled on ice cream as tasty topping. Cold ganache can be rolled into chocolate truffles.</p>

<p>My current favorite low carb sweetener I use in cooking is Sin-Free Sugar. It has a flavor very close to sugar, is all natural and calorie free. I prefer it to Truvia for various reasons. Truvia consists of erythritol, stevia and natural flavors. I notice when using Truvia in recipes that require a lot sweetener that it tends to become gritty upon cooling. I don’t run into this issue with Sin-Free since it consists of a blend of natural sugars your body does not absorb. For more information you can check out the Sin-Free Sugar website: <a href="https://www.sinfreesugar.com/">https://www.sinfreesugar.com/</a> .</p>

<p>The mixture will thicken to harden in the fridge. You can gently melt some in the microwave when you want to use it on your low carb deserts or you an add some to your coffee with a bit of cream for a real tasty coffee mocha.</p>

<p>The recipes yields about 29 oz with under 1 net carb for 2 oz serving.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/ganache_smaller.jpg" width="300"></p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
<li>8 oz unsweetened chocolate</li>
<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
<li>2 cups of Sin-Free Sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons SweetLeaf</li>
<li>4 tablespoons salted butter</li>
</ul>


<h4>Steps:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Chop unsweetened chocolate and butter, place into a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients together (Sin-Free Sugar, SweetLeaf) and place into a medium saucepan.</li>
<li>Add wet ingredients (heavy cream, vanilla) to saucepan, Stir until dry and wet ingredients are mixed well so that no large lumps are present.</li>
<li>Heat the mixture while stirring. When mixture bubbles and begins to climb the sides of the saucepan, turn off stove and remove from heat.</li>
<li>Add hot mixture to mixing bowl containing chocolate pieces and wait 1 minute.</li>
<li>Stir mixture in bowl until all chocolate is melted and well incorporated.</li>
<li>Whisk until smooth and slightly thickened.</li>
<li>Leave until a bit cooled and then move to a container and store in refrigerator.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently received the O2 Trainer as a present this past Christmas.
The idea of this product is to strengthen your diaphragm and lung muscles via resistance as you pull air into your lungs.
It consists of a mouth piece and interchangeable modules which provide 14 stages of resistance.
If you visit www.o2trainer.com you find various studies using the product, testimonials and instructions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
   O2 Trainer
</p>


<p>My purpose for the product is improving athletic performance.
I&rsquo;m currently a blue belt in Kenpo Karate, a style which utilizes quick hand strikes and kicks.
Sparring can be quite intense and can quickly cause one to run out of breath.
Tonight I started the first breathing exercise. Starting with module number 11, I did 4 sets of 12 reps.
One breathes in hard and then exhales. Once I was done and for a few hours after, I could feel that my diagram and abs got a good workout.
I look forward to continued use of this product and effect it has on my performance.</p>
