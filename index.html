<p>This following post covers a chapter from the book &lsquo;The $100 Startup&rsquo; written
by Chris Guillebeau. It illustrates some ideas on increasing income through some
small incremental improvements. We&rsquo;ll begin by defining some terms.</p>

<h2>Traffic, Conversion Rates and Average Sales Price</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll define &lsquo;traffic&rsquo; as visitors to a particular physical location or
website. If you own a store, it would mean the number of people walking in
the front door. If it&rsquo;s a website you own then it would be the number of
visitors to the site.</p>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll define &lsquo;conversation rate&rsquo; as the number of visitors that then
purchase something. If say 100 people visited our site and 3 purchase something
then we would have a conversation rate of 3%.</p>

<p>The first goal is getting a good amount of people walking in the door or
visiting your site. This could be accomplished with marketing, word of mouth,
social media campaigns, etc.</p>

<p>Without a good volume of attention from prospective customers, it would be
very difficult to grow a starting venture. Getting eyeballs on your products,
your store, your brand would be basic to beginning and continued growth.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to convert as many of those visitors as you can into customers. The
percentage of visitors become customer is the conversation rate.
The conversion rate for a brick and mortar store can be <a href="http://www.retailtouchpoints.com/retail-store-ops/19-retailers-counting-on-conversion-analysis-to-drive-store-metrics">from 20% - 40%</a>.
An online store the rate is more like <a href="http://www.searchmarketingstandard.com/what-is-the-average-conversion-rate">2% - 3%</a>.</p>

<p>A typical methodology for increasing conversion is A/B testing of promotional materials
and offers. For example an offer &lsquo;A&rsquo; is run and it converts 3% of visitors into
clients. Offer &lsquo;B&rsquo; is run and it converts at 5%. We now have a good indicator that
offers similar to that of &lsquo;B&rsquo; generates more clients.</p>

<p>Lastly is increasing average sales price. This can be accomplished through up-selling,
cross-selling and after sale offering.</p>

<h2>Up-selling, Cross-selling, and After Sale Offering</h2>

<p>Up-selling means to entice the customer to purchase a more expensive item, upgrade
or purchase add-ons inorder to make a more profitable sale. For example if someone
is buying a car, a sales person would attempt to have the person upgrade their car
with door edge protectors or wheel locks.</p>

<p>Cross-selling usually involves selling complimentary products to the customer. If you&rsquo;ve
shopped Amazon.com you&rsquo;ll often see suggested products in the form of, &ldquo;Customers
who bought this product also bought these.&rdquo; This is an attempt to have the customer
add additional merchandise to their order.</p>

<p>An after sale offering takes the form of sending a customer some sort of special
limited time offer after they have made a purchase in order to entice them to buy
more product.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The idea is that a small percentage increase in traffic, conversion rate and average
sales price results in a substantial overall increase in revenue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The post builds on my last blog post <a href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/28/yet-another-article-about-blocks/">&lsquo;Yet Another Article About Ruby Closures&rsquo;</a>.
We&rsquo;re going to take a quick peek into the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; operator as it applies to ruby blocks.
Let&rsquo;s take a look at some code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">blk</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">blk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I ran!&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#I ran!</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In when <code>&amp;</code> appears in front of an object as in <code>&amp;blk</code>, it can do one of three
things:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the object is a block, it&rsquo;ll convert it into a simple proc</li>
<li>if the object is a Proc, it&rsquo;ll convert it into a block</li>
<li>if the object is not a block nor Proc, it&rsquo;ll call #to_proc on the object.</li>
</ul>


<p>In our example above <code>&amp;blk</code> is converting the block <code>puts "I ran!"</code> into a simple
proc and assigning it to the variable <code>blk</code> which we can then invoke by calling <code>#call</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I ran!&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nb">proc</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#I ran!</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, in the example above, I first create a Proc and assign it to the variable <code>proc</code>.
Then I convert it to a block with <code>&amp;</code> and pass it to <code>Foo#run</code>.</p>

<p>On the next post I&rsquo;ll cover Symbol to proc which covers our last condition where
<code>#to_proc</code> is called on the object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>&#8220;User experience&#8221; encompasses all aspects of the end-user&#8217;s interaction <br/>with the company, its services, and its products.</p><footer><strong>JAKOB NIELSEN and DON NORMAN</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="right" src="/images/ux-badge.png" width="200"></p>

<p>Over the last couple of the months the company where I am currently employed has
sponsored company wide UX training through the Nielsen Norman Group(NN/g). I also
passed the examinations and I am now UX
Certified(<a href="http://www.nngroup.com/ux-certification#track.">UXC#1007600</a>)</p>

<p>NN/g is at the fore front of evidence based User Experience research. As a software
developer, I found it very sobering that what I and my other fellow coworkers
were building may not be all that comprehensible to the end user of the systems we
engineered. However, this problem was not unique to us. In fact companies such
as Pizza Hut, Amazon, Chipotle and others struggle with it all the time.</p>

<p>Anytime a user experiences frustration or confusion using or ordering a product,
you run a high probability of never seeing them again. We don&rsquo;t set out to build
products that are difficult to use. We want our customers to experience success
and return to us with future business again and again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the individuals building a product are too close to and too familiar
with the product to realize the difficulties apparent in its use. A creator will
place controls in a certain order and position. Since he has spent so much time
crafting and wiring those controls; what they do will be second nature to him. He
could very well know what each does with no need of labels or cues. However,
another may find these controls counter intuitive and confusing. The order of things
makes no sense and they do not do what he expects.</p>

<p>Another issue is creator pride which blinds us to the faults present. There are
times when we might create something like a piece of art, a dish to eat or another
creation. As the creator we might be blind to poor composition of the art work or the
lack of flavor in a meal which is so apparent to another.</p>

<p>For this reason its important to validate what we build. We must seek out the
brutally honest opinion of the end consumer, of the end user. Does he enjoy using
the product? Does he find it confusing? The way these sort of tests
are conducted so as to obtain statistically valid and actionable results without
influencing the subject is at the core of NN/g training.</p>

<p>Lets view a couple of videos.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBUWxROnqwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>The Ring was a Kickstarter funded project with great promises to control all sorts
of other electronic devices through various hand gestures. The reviewer really digs
into them hard for what he perceived as an incredibly poor user experience. He
found the product difficult to use, failing incredibly in delivering its promise.</p>

<p>Takuro Yoshida, the Ring creator, responded to the harsh reviews of his
<a href="https://www.techinasia.com/ring-kickstarter-wearable-ceo-responds-to-criticism/">product</a>.
From the interview, it does appear that there is a user experience disconnect at the
very least with a portion of Ring users. If you read the interview you&rsquo;ll notice this
statement by the interviewer.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yoshida passed me his ring and I was able to learn six gestures in a matter of minutes. Without his instruction, I probably wouldn’t have realized that I was flicking my wrist too much (you should only move your finger) or moving too much after completing a gesture (you have to hold still for a moment for the gesture to register).</p></blockquote>


<p>This seems to indicate that indeed the product is just not that intuitive to
some people. I hope the company manages to address these issues whether actual
or just perceived. I can see how the idea of controlling your electronics
through hand gestures can be very appealing.</p>

<p>Well, I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this. Till next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/closures_keyboard.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>Today was the first day of company sponsored training on react.js, the new snazzy
js library by the fine folks at Facebook. Our instructor Ryan Florence was
apparently familiar with Ruby and quizzed me a bit on Procs and lambdas. I tend to use
blocks most often, lambdas quite infrequently and Procs very, very rarely.
As such I felt my knowledge of these deserved a little review and what better
way to review than to write a little article about the subject and share it
with all of you.</p>

<h2>Closures</h2>

<p>Ruby Blocks, Procs and lambdas are basically Ruby&rsquo;s implementation on closures.
If you&rsquo;re familiar with what a closure is, it&rsquo;s basically a piece of code that
is bound to the environment in which that piece of code was defined.</p>

<h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>Ruby blocks are syntax literals for Proc objects, defined as instructions
between curly braces <code>{}</code> or <code>do...end</code> phrases for multiline blocks which may
optionally take arguments and return values.</p>

<p>In the example given above on line 10 thru 12 we are creating a block. The block
consists of the code on line 11 along with it&rsquo;s environment. This block is sent over
to line 3 where it called implicitly by the <code>yield</code> statement.</p>

<h2>Procs</h2>

<p>Proc is short for procedure. A Proc is a encapsulation of code used to perform
a specific task. A way of thinking of Procs and their behavior is like this.</p>

<p>If a Proc contains a <code>return</code> it will do a hard <code>return</code> and exit completely out of
the method it called. As such <code>"Ho"</code> will never be printed to the console.</p>

<p>This makes sense since it is designed as encapulation of
a procedure. As you can see from the example above the Proc#call on line 3 is
functionally equivalent to line 21-22.</p>

<h2>Lambda</h2>

<p>Lambda get its name from lambda calculus. In this sense lambdas take the form
of anonymous functions.</p>

<p>The difference between <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> is that <code>Foo#run</code> executes an anonymous
method defined by the lambda where as <code>Bar#run</code> executes the named method
<code>Bar#lam</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>return</code> statement in the lambda returns from the anonymous method just
as a <code>return</code> in a named method will return from that method. Thus it will not
exit out of the method in which it was invoked.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So I know I&rsquo;m skipping a whole bunch of stuff regrading Blocks, Procs and Lambdas
like parameter passing and appearance in argument lists but unfortunately I got
a late start on this article so I&rsquo;ll have to write some supplements to this
in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Bye.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/confusion_scrabble.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>I was going to name this article, &ldquo;Algebra for everyday problem solving,&rdquo; but
I was concerned many people would assume this had to do with figuring out the
speed of a train having left the station two hours ago. Well, that&rsquo;s not what this
all about. Instead it&rsquo;s much more interesting.</p>

<p>Lets look at some basic algebra and then I&rsquo;ll elaborate.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">therefore</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we look at the problem on line 1 above, we see that at first we don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;x&rsquo; is.
What we do know is that 10 plus that value will yield us 12. So it&rsquo;s very easy to then determine
that &lsquo;x&rsquo; is in fact equal to &lsquo;2&rsquo;. So what just happened here?</p>

<p>What happened is that we had an unknown (x), two knowns (10 and 12) and an
established relationship between them and from that we were able to determine the unknown.</p>

<h2>The Confusion</h2>

<p>A confusion is often made of several unknown factors. The more unknowns the more
confusing the situation can be. Likewise, the more knowns there are the less confusion
there is. This then can aid us in gaining a foothold into the resolution problems.</p>

<p>One must operate from those elements which have the highest degree of certainty and
truth. From that solid foundation we attempt to solve one of the unkowns, then another and
another until all elements are solved.</p>

<p>For example, the police find a dead body? Who is it? How did he die? When? Was it murder?
Who killed him? There are many unknowns. They run his fingerprints and find out who he is.
They take the body to the coroner and get the time of death and probable cause of death.
Now they know it was Joe Burns, he died 48 hours ago and he was struck with a bat
which caused the death. They now have some nice solid knowns to operate from from.</p>

<p>Since they know he died 48 hours ago, they canvas the area looking for witnesses present
around that time. They can also use the time of death to eliminate suspects by
verifying alibis. They can look for a particular murder weapon.
With his ID, they can find his friends and family and ascertain possible
suspects.</p>

<p>Thus the police can begin to solve this mystery from building more and more knowns from
a declining number unknowns.</p>

<h2>Look Out for&hellip;</h2>

<p>One tries to operate from highest known one can achieve. This does not mean the
&lsquo;known&rsquo; is necessarily correct; it&rsquo;s just the most correct datum we have
available. For example in our crime drama, it&rsquo;s possible the
body may have been affected by some process which caused an incorrect conclusion as to
the time of death. Thus shifting the time line of events.</p>

<p>Occam&rsquo;s razor is very often misstated as the simplest answer is usually the correct
one. This is quite an incorrect statement. Actually, the principle states that the answer
with the least number of assumptions is the correct one. Complexity is not the issue,
assumptions are the problem.</p>

<p>So, beware of operating off of assumptions and here-say. The best thing is as direct an observation
as one can obtain. In solving issues at work, solutions have often been delayed by just taking
a coworkers word for it. This is not to say people are not truthful it&rsquo;s just that
we often have issues recalling things accurately or we might miscommunicate what we have
observed.</p>

<p>Play a game of telephone sometime with a group of friends and you&rsquo;ll be amazed how easily
facts are distorted within a few retellings.</p>

<p>Well, I hope this has been of value.</p>

<p>Take Care.</p>

<p>Hello all. Thanks for coming by for TGIF 4. It&rsquo;s been another week and time
to end it with some vids. The theme this week is touchingly sweet videos that
will probably give you cavities. Hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>According to person who uploaded this video, &ldquo;The fireworks show had just ended,
but she thought she kept hearing them outside. So we sang to keep her mind preoccupied.
In the end, nothing competes with fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ok, so I took an old play from the American media and used a sensationalized
title to get your attention. The fact is that I like ActiveRecord, I really do.
In fact I like it a little too much.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so you should read my last blog post titled <a href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/19/easy-vs-simple/">&lsquo;Easy vs Simple&rsquo;</a>.
It&rsquo;s an article very much inspired by a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">talk</a>
given by the creator of Clojure, Rich Hickey. The point my article and one of the many fine
points in Hickey&rsquo;s lecture attempts to make is that we as developers
have become obsessed with this idea of &lsquo;easy&rsquo;. So much are we enamored by it that
we&rsquo;re trading it in for a vast amount of complexity and inefficiency.</p>

<p>Giving you a little of my background, I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure working for two very
experienced and well known people in our profession. The first was Dave Thomas author
of the Pickaxe Book and Hal Helms who is very well known in the ColdFusion community.
I currently work for Hal and we have some fairly interesting discussions and arguements.
One revolves around ORMs. He is very  much of the opinion that we should not
use an ORM at all in Rails, at least he leans in that direction. While I am not such an
extremist, I have been tempering my enthusiasm for ActiveRecord with recent real world
experience dealing with performance issues.</p>

<h2>ActiveRecord is Fat</h2>

<p>How fat? When ActiveRecord sits around the house, it sits AROUND the house. I know bad
joke. Look, all the magic ActiveRecord does requires a significant amount
code which then leads to large amount of <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2009/thats-not-a-memory-leak-its-bloat/">memory</a>
used to spin up an instance. Spin up enough ActiveRecord instances that are not
garbage collected quick enough and the available memory on your box might be
all consumed.</p>

<p>ActiveRecord instances do a lot: persistence, validation, query generation, domain logic
and more. Yes it makes things easy and possibly makes code more readable but you&rsquo;re adding
complexity at least in the background. If you&rsquo;ve ever run into a new deep ActiveRecord bug,
good luck digging into that code for the first time.</p>

<h2>Your Classes Become Dependent on ActiveRecord</h2>

<p>The Foo class is dependent on ActiveRecord. In order to run my rspec
tests on this code I&rsquo;ll have to load rails. Foo also expects the business
object to respond to #owners and each instance of owner to respond to #name.
This is quite a bit that we&rsquo;re asking Foo to know about the business object.
Foo is also sensitive to changes made to Business as well such that if we chose
to drop or rename the association to owners, the class would break.
A good article related to this is <a href="https://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">&ldquo;Tell, Don&rsquo;t Ask&rdquo;</a>
which warns about this type of inadvertent coupling.</p>

<p>What we should be sending Foo is data not an object containing data that then needs
to be queried through it&rsquo;s api. Yes, I know a Hash is still
an object but I&rsquo;m speaking semantically. As you can see, Bar is given a Hash only.
There is no dependency on rails so my test can be run without loading rails and thus
can be run much faster. We no longer have the coupling we witnessed before.</p>

<h2>ActiveRecord is Lousy at Generating SQL</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the fault of ActiveRecord, ORMs all have their limits.
For simple queries it works fine. Realize though that as your queries become
more complex and intricate the worse the SQL will be that AR generates. There&rsquo;s
just no way an ORM can craft a highly optimized complex query better than an
experienced engineer.</p>

<p>A backwards thing I catch myself doing sometimes is mentally figuring out how a non-trivial
query would be crafted in SQL and then I try to rewrite it into AR. I think at that point
I should do it in SQL.</p>

<h2>ActiveRecord, not so readable</h2>

<p>Take a look at code above. Can you imagine writing this in ActiveRecord. You&rsquo;d
have various calls to #joins, #group, #select, #from plus a fair share
of SQL fragments strewn about. For me the code above appears far more legible
that trying to express it in AR.</p>

<p>The last point I like to make is that I think there&rsquo;s an illness going around.
It might be caused by overzealous enthusiasm, inexperience or unwavering conviction.
But I&rsquo;ve seen it so many times; people become entranced with an ideal, rushing towards it
like a month to flame without the slightest thought to consequence or foresight. Again
I&rsquo;m a fan of ActiveRecord for the ease it brings but let&rsquo;s also consider the cost
as well.</p>

<p>Take Care.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/easy_street.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>The meaning of words naturally evolve over time. As a consequence certain words
will unfortunately lose their distinctive meaning and become an undistinguished
synonym for another word. This is what I believe has happened with the words
&lsquo;easy&rsquo; and &lsquo;simple&rsquo; which are now used quite interchangeablely. The original
meaning of these words can help us illustrate a very important idea.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by looking at their definitions.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<blockquote><p>easy - requiring little effort; presenting few difficulties; not difficult.</p><p>simple - easily done, used, or understood.</p><footer><strong>Macmillian Dictionary for Students</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>As you can see these words are very close in meaning today. Let&rsquo;s take a look
at what they used to mean.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>&lsquo;Easy&rsquo; originally came from the Latin word ADJACERE which means to lie near. This
makes sense as those things which lie near physically or mentally are easy to
reach.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Simple&rsquo; comes for the Latin word SIMPLEX which means single fold. In other words
something is simple when it consists of very few parts. Thus when something
has little in the way of parts it then is not a difficult thing to grasp.</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out the origin of &lsquo;easy&rsquo; implies a certain subjectivity. As
things which are easy for me (near my mind) ,due to my experience, may not
be easy for someone else. In contrast &lsquo;simple&rsquo; is more objective. The more parts
and more intertwined and dependent those parts are of a thing, the less simple
that thing is.</p>

<p>For example Spanish is a simple language, Grammatically, it has fewer
irregularities than other romance languages. This would be an objective
statement.</p>

<p>However Spanish is easy for me since it&rsquo;s my first language and
difficult for my wife since she does not speak it. Thus we see easy
take on a more subjective role.</p>

<h2>Okay, so what?</h2>

<p>We are obsessed with the easy at the cost of complexity.The benefits or
detriments can be argued but it is none the less there. It is easy (close, near)
to go to the market and purchase a carton of orange juice but have you ever
wondered how complex (many parts) it was to produce that carton and it&rsquo;s contents?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s far easier to use power windows but the mechanism has many parts and with
many parts comes the probability that something will go wrong sooner than a simpler
mechanism,  requiring service. It can be easy to ship a package but not so simple to find
one lost in the labyrinth it traveled.</p>

<p>Cheating, stealing and lying are all easy. We gain what we desire immediately.
The consequence is complexity. Keeping track of the lies told, avoiding discovery,
and having people distrust and hate us does not a simple life make.</p>

<p>This trade off between easy and simple is especially of concern to those who
build things such as engineers. Some select at tool or technique because
of it&rsquo;s ease of use yet it may actually lead to a complex structure which is
difficult to maintain and service.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind when doing something because it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
