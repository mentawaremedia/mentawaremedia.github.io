    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/fast_snail.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>For the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been busy at work optimizing many of our
slowest queries. On my last Rails related post I covered a work around for
PostgreSQL&rsquo;s inherit slowness with COUNT queries. On this post I&rsquo;m covering
some common tips for speeding up general queries.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by looking at some code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#app/serializers/business_serializer.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BusinessSerializer</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveModel</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Serializer</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attributes</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:zip</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#app/controllers/businesses_controller#any_ten_records</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Business</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:amount</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:created_at</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the code above I use <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">ActiveModel::Serializers</a>
to describe which model attributes will be serialized into JSON. If you are unfamiliar
with this gem consider reading up on it. It&rsquo;s pretty handy for DRYing up your code. The
database I am using is PostgreSQL.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t SELECT *</h2>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#Business.where(&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;, params[:amount], 100).order(:created_at).to_a.first(10)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Business</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:zip</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:amount</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:created_at</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_a</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The serailizer tells me that the only thing I need to return is <code>business#name</code>
and <code>business#zip</code>. The more record columns you request data on, the slower your
query might run as it will use more Network I/O and sometimes Disk I/O.
You could boost performance by selecting only the columns you require.</p>

<h2>Filter Rows With Limit</h2>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#Business.select(:name, :zip)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .where(&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;, params[:amount], 100)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .order(:created_at)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .to_a</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .first(10)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Business</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:zip</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:amount</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:created_at</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can see from <code>#first(10)</code> that we are only interested in returning the first
ten records we fetched from the query. We could potentially and unnecessarily
request a huge record set and consume a ton of memory by instantiating those
records as ActiveRecord objects.</p>

<h2>Avoid Sorting</h2>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#Business.select(:name, :zip)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .where(&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;, params[:amount], 100)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .limit(10)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .order(:created_at)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Business</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:zip</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:amount</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sorting is sometimes unavoidable but we should try not to utilize it when
possible. The <code>ORDER BY</code> generated will consume sorting memory on the server.
In cases where memory becomes scarce on the server, it will spill over to
disk making it painfully slow.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t Accidentally Skip Using an Index</h2>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#Business.select(:name, :zip)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .where(&quot;revenue + ? = ?&quot;, params[:amount], 100)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#  .limit(10)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Business</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:zip</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;revenue = ? - ?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:amount</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If the businesses table is using an index on the field revenue, the original code
would skip using the index. To take advantage of the index we need to shift the
calculation from the left hand side of the equation to the right hand side.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/12/build-measure-learn/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-12T14:34:48-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/12/build-measure-learn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/build-measure-learn.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>Some months ago I came across a list of top books recommended by
successful entrepreneurs. Towards the top of this list was the
book &lsquo;The Lean Startup&rsquo;. I highly recommend this book to anyone
looking to start their own business or anyone involved in management.</p>

<p>One of the major concepts in the lean startup method is what&rsquo;s referred to
as the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. The basic idea is a cycle of
of building a product, measuring success then learning from this measurement
and other actions so as to build a better product and finally start
the cycle again. It is a way managing uncertainty and risk.</p>

<p>Realize that it&rsquo;s the speed at which this cycle occurs that most likely
determines success. A startup or new venture has a limited amount of time
and/or funds in order to become a viable concern. Once these resources are
consumed and no other options are present; the startup is done. This is why
speed is of essence.</p>

<p>While the cycle seems straight forward, each of these points on the cycle
has it&rsquo;s challenges.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The Lean Startup has the concept of a Minimal Viable Product or MVP.
The idea is that you never build more than what is needed to learn.
While we would all love to produce a beautiful finished and polished
piece of work, it comes at a price. The price is time and waste.</p>

<p>What benefit is it to create a &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; product that no one will ever buy?
The end result is a tremendous investment in time with the end result of
learning that no one wants it. One could have learned this in the fraction
of the time and expense with an MVP.</p>

<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>Learn to measure and track meaningful things that will guide you in determining
if your product is proving successful. The book covers in detail the difference
between actionable metrics and vanity metrics. In order for a metric to be
actionable it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Otherwise the metric
could lead you astray giving you a false sense of security.</p>

<h2>Learn</h2>

<p>Are you taking what you&rsquo;ve learned from your metrics to build an even better
product or are you randomly dropping in product features and strategies simply
because it &lsquo;feels right&rsquo; or it sounds like a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;? At what point do
you make a fundamental change to you business based on the learning you done
so far? What have we learned and what are we doing about it?</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little article.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been sticking to a pattern that has worked well
for me for releasing new blog content. On Mondays I&rsquo;ll post an article on self
improvement or health related topic. Wednesday I&rsquo;ll release an article for
folks doing software development and Fridays I&rsquo;ll close out the week with
something fun such as some interesting Youtube videos. Thanks to all my
return visitors. I hope you come back soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello All and Thank God It&rsquo;s Friday. It&rsquo;s been a very busy week
and I ready to relax with some fun vids. In view that the release
of Avengers 2 is right around the corner, I think we&rsquo;ll theme this post
with one my favorite Avengers, Thor.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a comic book history lesson. It would surprise you to know
that Thor used to have a secret identity.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more epic than an epic rap battle? Nothing of course.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like me then sometimes you lay awake at night wondering who would win
in fight; Thor or Superman?</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">

<p>If you&rsquo;re fan of the old Hulk television series, you might be happy to know that
there was a television movie a few years after the series was cancelled with
an appearance of Thor.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for now. Have a good one.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/07/faster-count-queries/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-07T16:11:47-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/07/faster-count-queries</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/cheetah_still.jpg" width="150"></p>

<p>Some of you have noticed that PostgreSQL&rsquo;s count performs painfully slow on tables
of any significant size. If you&rsquo;re looking for a quick solution and you don&rsquo;t
care about super exact numbers on the count then I&rsquo;ll show you what I did.</p>

<p>The reason counts are so slow in postgres has to do with the way Multi-Version
Concurrency Control(MVCC) has been implemented in the
<a href="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Slow_Counting">product</a>. Since multiple transactions
can see different states of the data then there can be no straightforward way for &ldquo;COUNT(*)&rdquo;
to summarize data across the whole table. As a result postgres must walk through all rows
in a sense.</p>

<p>I found an interesting article on how to accomplish a much faster, although less accurate
count by tapping into the EXPLAIN output through a custom <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Count_estimate">function</a>.
I&rsquo;ll walk you through the steps I took.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>count_estimate function</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

those single quotes by using two single quotes <code>''</code> otherwise you&rsquo;ll get a SQL error on the syntax.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/05/the-pareto-principle/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-05T17:51:33-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/05/the-pareto-principle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a very powerful principle and it can be quite
transformative if you can learn to spot it and apply it to your daily life.
I first became aware of the Pareto Principle when I worked as a
developer at a company in the business of selling software to mid-level
manufacturing companies.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/pareto-principle.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>The Pareto Principle goes by many names such the 80/20 principle, Pareto&rsquo;s
Law, the law of the vital few and more. What it basically states is that
20% of the causes drive 80% of the effects. Another way of saying this is
that 20% of the inputs results in 80% of the outputs. For example a company
will likely find that 20% of their customers generate 80% of their income.</p>

<p>Microsoft found that fixing the top 20% of the most reported bugs eliminated
80% of the related errors and crashes in a given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">system</a>.
Other observations have included things such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>20% of motorists cause 80% of traffic accidents</li>
<li>20% of criminals account for 80% of the value of all crime</li>
<li>20% of the clothes a person person owns is worn 80% of the time.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was recently reintroduced to the principle upon reading Tim Ferriss&#8217; book,
The 4-hour Workweek. He drives home the idea of eliminating waste through its
use and this is one way the principle can be transformative.</p>

<p>If a company realizes that 80% of it&rsquo;s time is consumed by 20% of its customers
then it must ask itself the hard question, &ldquo;Should we part ways with those clients.&rdquo;
If those clients are contribiting only a small amount of the revenue but
are capitalizing most of the time then indeed parting ways maybe the smart choice.</p>

<p>We may find in our own daily lives that 20% of our activities consume
80% of our time. These activities could consist of web surfing, answering
emails, and other unproductive activities. Should we remove or greatly
limit these activities then we could recoop signifact chunks of time
as well as reduce our stress.</p>

<p>Give it some thought and see if this principle can be applied to an area
of your life, activity or business.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following is a quick intro to Ruby&rsquo;s Binding object. The Binding object
holds the execution context of that particular scope. You can evaluate
variables against a particular binding to fetch or set the values of those
variables. Let&rsquo;s look at some code and then walkthrough what is happening.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;re going to do in the following piece of code is capture the local
variables within the scope of Foo#run and send them to our error reporting
service which simply puts out the results to the console. In this example I am
using Ruby version 2.2.1.</p>

<p>If you notice on lines 3-4, we&rsquo;ve set a few local variables. On line 8, we
intentionally raise an error. Line 10 sends our reporting service a hash
containing all variables in that scope with their values. The hash is
generated by the method #capture_variables.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the method works. We send it the current binding by simply sending it
&lsquo;binding&rsquo; as seen on line 10. We also send it an array of symbols representing any local
variables we&rsquo;re not interested in reporting which in our case is &lsquo;e&rsquo;.</p>

<p>On line 22 we call Binding#local_variables which returns an array of symbols
representing the local variables we defined. We iterate over the collection
of symbols with #inject so as to build a hash with the keys being the
variable names and the values the variable values.</p>

<p>On line 27 we call Binding#local_variable_get to fetch the value of the local
variable as defined in previous execution context. Now we execute Foo.new.run to
see what we get.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Console Output </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="gp">&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kp">nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see above our reporting service is receiving the hash as expected.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/03/22/a-blow-against-grammar-nazis/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-22T15:06:11-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/03/22/a-blow-against-grammar-nazis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/raine.jpg" width="473" title="" ></p>

<blockquote><p>You probably heard we ain&#8217;t in the prisoner-takin&#8217; business; <br/>we in the killin&#8217; Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin&#8217;.</p><footer><strong>Lt. Aldo Raine</strong> <cite>Inglourious Basterds</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I recognize that grammar is important. Use of proper grammar not only
sounds pleasant, it also ensures a higher degree of
clarity on the subject one is addressing. So while I am not saying grammar doesn&rsquo;t
matter, I would like to address several myths and misconceptions regarding grammar
as well as some thoughts regarding the correction of another&rsquo;s grammar in everyday
speech.</p>

<p>Alright, see if this sounds familiar. You&rsquo;re having a discussion with someone and the
grammar Nazi all of a sudden objects to something you&rsquo;ve said.
As if you&rsquo;ve offended his mother he says, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not
correct. There is no such word as that,&rdquo; or he&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re using that incorrectly,&rdquo;
or some such claim.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you a couple of good ways to defend yourself so you don&rsquo;t
feel completely victimized. After all this is &lsquo;merica!
And there&rsquo;s nothing Americans like more than kill&#8217;n some Nazis.</p>

<h2>That Word Does Not Exist</h2>

<p>First off, what the Nazi really means is that the word doesn&rsquo;t exist in the
dictionary. Now that assumes that presence in a dictionary is the absolute
authority on whether a word exists or not, which it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Most English dictionaries include only those words that meet certain criteria
of <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq/words_in.htm">usage</a>. Because of this
words that are still in the process of becoming established are often omitted.
Some words are so informal or specialized that they are rarely documented in
professionally edited works. However these words are as real as those that have
gained entry with the only difference that they haven&rsquo;t met the strict criteria for
being <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq/real_words.htm">entered</a>.</p>

<h2>Nonstandard Words</h2>

<p>A nonstandard word is defined as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Not conforming to the speech or grammar of educated people and often <br/>regarded as a marker of low social status.</p><footer><strong>Random House Webster&#8217;s College Dictionary</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the connotation of social status in connection to nonstandard words.
I&rsquo;ll comment on that a bit later.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of nonstandard words:</p>

<ul>
<li>ain&rsquo;t - You ain&rsquo;t the law.</li>
<li>nohow - We could nohow make out his handwriting.</li>
<li>irregardless - I&rsquo;ll buy it irregardless of cost.</li>
</ul>


<p>However allowances are given to the use of nonstandard words in certain situations.
In fiction, use of nonstandard words is allowed in the dialogue of characters so as
to reflect the character&rsquo;s background and level of education.
Educated speakers will often use nonstandard forms to set a popular or informal
<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonstandard">tone</a>.</p>

<p>Nonstandard forms can be perfectly acceptable in certain regions. An example is the
unrecognized contraction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%27all">&ldquo;y&#8217;all&rdquo;</a>. It is the
nonstandard form of the contraction &lsquo;you&rsquo; and &lsquo;all&rsquo;, yet commonly
used throughout the southern United States.</p>

<p>It is the view of some linguists that what is considered standard english is a
matter of societal opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is important to understand that identifying a dialect as standard or <br/>nonstandard is a sociological judgment, not a linguistic one.</p><footer><strong>F. Parker and K. Riley</strong> <cite>Linguistics for Non-Linguists</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Take for example the rule against the use of double negatives. It says that two
negatives cancel each other out. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get no satisfaction.&rdquo;, basically means that
I can get satisfaction. However this rule didn&rsquo;t see application until after the 17th
century when certain writers sought to relate the rules of the language to logic and
<a href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/">mathematics</a>.
Prior to that it was common to use double negatives as emphasizing a negative.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous…</p><footer><strong>Chaucer</strong> <cite>The Friar’s Tale</cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I never was nor never will be.</p><footer><strong>Shakespeare</strong> <cite>Richard III</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the use of double negatives in some of these great literary works of
the English language.</p>

<p>My point is that nonstandard words do have a place in everyday speech and it doesn&rsquo;t
automatically make them completely unacceptable.</p>

<h2>Rules for the Sake of Rules</h2>

<p>As I said earlier the reason for grammar is that it provides the rules of language
structure so that individuals can understand one another. The more a person diverges
from proper grammar the greater his risk of either being misunderstood or not understood
at all.</p>

<p>However, the Nazi will commonly object to perfectly understandable speech merely
on the fact that it is not, in the strictest sense, perfect grammar. I believe
this to be an unreasonable expectation of informal speech.</p>

<p>I liken this to driving with the passenger objecting every time you drive a mile or two
over the speed limit, questioning your ability to drive and commenting on how you
are hazard to other drivers on the road. All because you are not strictly following
the rules of the road.</p>

<h2>Train of Thought</h2>

<p>Questioning someone&rsquo;s grammar usage is disruptive to the current
conversation. Realize that whatever you were discussing has now taken a backseat
to a grammar lesson. Continue this action long enough and you&rsquo;re liable to not
get much done or waste others&#8217; time.</p>

<p>I would especially question this practice in a work setting such as a meeting.
Is the subject you&rsquo;re meeting about so unimportant that it&rsquo;s acceptable to sidetrack
it with a discussion on grammar? However, if you&rsquo;re the boss then feel free to
teach as you&rsquo;re paying your employees to attend this lesson.</p>

<h2>Etiquette</h2>

<blockquote><p>Unless he is teaching an English class,<br/>a gentleman does not corrects another person&#8217;s grammar.</p><footer><strong>John Bridges & Bryan Curtis</strong> <cite>As a Gentleman Would Say: Responses to Life&#8217;s Important (and Sometimes Awkward) Situations</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Manners is the grease which eases the friction of human relations. Many times those who
use poor grammar are individuals to whom English is a second language. Other times they
may have only a rudimentary education. Drawing attention to their use
of poor grammar is tantamount to calling them stupid or of lower class than you.
This is compounded when such corrections are done in the presence of others.</p>

<p>If someone calls your grammar into question then feel free to call their etiquette
into question. Be an Etiquette Nazi and see how they like it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t behave like the guy at the gym who walks up to someone criticizing their form or
workout without being solicited to do so.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a word that does not exist, only words that are not
commonly used. There are cases where nonstandard forms are perfectly acceptable. Grammar
helps us understand each other, it is not just a bunch of rules for the sake of rules.
Interrupting someone&rsquo;s train of thought is disruptive and can be considered rude.</p>

<p>In closing I leave you with this funny skit by the guys at College Humor. Notice the Nazi
falls victim to his own unrelenting criticisms because even the most pedantic grammar critic
will at some point make his own grammatical transgression.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/shawshank_red.jpg" width="473" height="358"></p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to remind <br/>myself that some birds aren&#8217;t meant to be caged, that&#8217;s all. Their <br/>feathers are just too bright and when they fly away, the part <br/>of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice&#8230;but still, <br/>the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they&#8217;re gone.</p><footer><strong>Red</strong> <cite>The Shawshank Redemption</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>There are times when you miss a fomer coworker. Maybe they were really good at what
they did. Perhaps they were clever, upbeat or eccentric. Or maybe they offered much
needed comic relief.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago one of my coworkers decided to take a couple years off from work to
strike it on his own to build a product he&rsquo;s passionate about without the
daily pressures of a job.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a young guy with his own offbeat sense of humor. Those of us that worked with him
found him quite hilarious.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what inspired me to do this but I drew a caricature of him on dry erase
painted wall of our office and I every so often I update the captions on it. People read
it have a good laugh and it&rsquo;s almost like he never left.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/hpisms_1.jpg" width="900"></p>

<p>Now, this coworker is a young guy just a few years out of college. He is an atheist who
seems to disappear into his room for days according to his roommate. He loves to play
video games downing a six pack of Monster Energy drinks and a family size bag of Skittles&hellip;
ok, I made up that last bit.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/hpisms_2.jpg" width="900"></p>

<p>I theorize that he must be keeping a joural of all the wrongs inflicted on him by the
world yet I have absolutely no proof whatsoever. He apparently is not compelled to give
Christmas presents to his family yet for some strange reason has no problem accepting
them.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-20T20:53:35-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/03/20/class-class</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This will post will be short and sweet; we&rsquo;ll cover the Ruby class Class. For
those unfamiliar with the class called Class, it is basically a Ruby object for creating
Ruby classes. This comes in very handy when doing metaprogramming or writing code that
generates code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Typical Way of Creating a class</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hey</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s2">&quot;hey&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Above you&rsquo;ll see the regular old way of creating a class in Ruby.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Class Way of Creating a class</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hey</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s2">&quot;hey&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can do the exact same thing using Class as the example above shows. Subclassing
can also be done very easily.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Typical Way of Subclassing</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Bar</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Foo</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Above is how one would typically do subclassing. Class Bar inherits from class Foo.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Class Way of Subclassing</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Foo</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And here is how it&rsquo;s accomplished with class Class.</p>

<p>A usual situation where I use Class is when I need to create custom errors. I think
we can all be code snobs from time to time (I hope it&rsquo;s not just me) so I maybe overly
critical when I say the following. When people attempt to cram multiple lines of ruby
code on one line using &lsquo;;&rsquo;, a little piece of my dies.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>&#8230;kill me now</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">NameNotDefined</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">RuntimeError</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Is it just me or is the above just painful to look at?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>A blissful expression</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">NameNotDefined</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">RuntimeError</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now isn&rsquo;t this so much better? I can now relax.</p>

<p>I hope it&rsquo;s been educational. Feel free to drop some comments or questions below. And if you liked it then

<p>Many languages use a &lsquo;new&rsquo; keyword which Ruby does not have to create an object instance.
Ruby instead provides a method &lsquo;new&rsquo; which is called directly on a class.</p>

<h2>Ruby Constructor Responsibilities</h2>

<p>The Ruby Constructor has three jobs.</p>

<ul>
<li>It allocates space for the object</li>
<li>It assigns instances variables their initial values</li>
<li>It returns the instance of that class</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Ruby Constructor Responsibilities</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bar</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="vi">@biz</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">biz</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Wait a second!? Why are we talking about &lsquo;initialize&rsquo; all of a sudden?
I thought we were talking about &lsquo;new&rsquo;?</p>

<ul>
<li>#initialize is an instance method</li>
<li>.new is a class method</li>
</ul>


<p>To clarify, .new is the ruby constructor not the instance method #initialize. Remember,
the constructor performs three actions.</p>

<ul>
<li>It allocates space for a new instance of the class</li>
<li>It assigns instances variables their initial values</li>
<li>It returns the instance of that class</li>
</ul>


<p>The class method .new performs these actions, not #initialize which is used for
assigning instances variables their initial values.</p>

<p>We can implement our own version of the .new method to illustrate how it might
accomplish this.</p>

<p>As you can see above, our own custom constructor is functionally equivalent
to the default constructor. Both constructors return an instance of class Foo
with their instance variables set. This knowledge can help us do some pretty neat things.</p>

<h2>Constructor overloading&hellip;sort of</h2>

<p>One of the things I used to miss when I started working in Ruby was the ability to
overload constructors. Strictly speaking, overloading uses the same constructor
method name but uses a different signature or parameter list which you can&rsquo;t do in
Ruby.</p>

<p>We can accomplish a similar goal by creating our own custom constructors.
Then we can see our custom constructors in action above.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The ruby constructor performs 3 jobs; allocates space, assigns
instance variables and returns the instance. The method .new is a class method and
constructor; #initialize is an instance method used to assign instance variables.
You can write your own constructors for fun and profit.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-28T20:21:02-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/28/pay-your-credit-cards-6-times-faster</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8230;compound interest is the second greatest invention of mankind</p><footer><strong>John Maynard Keynes</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p><img class="left" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/creditcards.jpg" width="250"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to look at three different
ways of paying off credit cards. Some bad and some good.
We&rsquo;ll calculate how much you&rsquo;re
paying on interest and the amount of time it&rsquo;ll take to pay off each card.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> Balance </th>
<th> Interest Rate </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td> 2,000   </td>
<td>           29% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td> 2,000   </td>
<td>           15% </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td> 2,000   </td>
<td>           11% </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/><br/>
Above we have three cards setup, each with a balance of 2,000 dollars and interest rates of
29%, 15% and 11%. We&rsquo;ll assume the minimum monthly payment to be 4% or $15 whichever is
greater.</p>

<h2>The Typical: Paying the minimum.</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTH 1 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 6 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 12 PAYMENT </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           71.05 </td>
<td>            64.19 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           65.58 </td>
<td>            55.30 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           64.08 </td>
<td>            52.98 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>          200.71 </td>
<td>           172.47 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
Since the balance of each card drops as payments are made then it&rsquo;s only natural
for the minimum payment due to also drop. If a person is in the habit of paying the
minimum then his payments will resemble the pattern above.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTHS TO PAY OFF </th>
<th> INTEREST </th>
<th> TOTAL PAID </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>               137 </td>
<td> 2,428.97 </td>
<td>   4,428.97 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>                89 </td>
<td>   767.12 </td>
<td>   2,767.12 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>                82 </td>
<td>   506.75 </td>
<td>   2,506.75 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>               137 </td>
<td> 3,702.84 </td>
<td>   9,702.84 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
The above are the results of making minimum payments. It took 137 months or 11 years and 6
months to pay off all this debt. The $6,000 of debt we started with took a total of
$9,702.84 in payments to eliminate; basically adding $3,702.84 of interest payments to the
$6,000 we initially had. That&rsquo;s a lot of money spent on interest.</p>

<h2>Better: Fixed payments.</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTH 1 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 6 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 12 PAYMENT </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>            80.00 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>            80.00 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>            80.00 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>           240.00 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
A better way is to just keep paying our initial minimum payment each month.
This way more and more of our payment will go towards the principal or original
debt. This will accelerate our pay off time.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTHS TO PAY OFF </th>
<th> INTEREST </th>
<th> TOTAL PAID </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>                38 </td>
<td>   986.50 </td>
<td>   2,986.50 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>                30 </td>
<td>   377.06 </td>
<td>   2,377.06 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>                29 </td>
<td>   258.38 </td>
<td>   2,258.38 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>                38 </td>
<td> 1,621.94 </td>
<td>   7,621.94 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
Applying a fixed payment scheme has saved us a considerable amount of time and money.
It took us only 3 years and 2 months to pay the debt and we saved $2,080.90 in interest. There
is however an even faster way to pay this off using the same total monthly payment amount.</p>

<h2>Best: Adjusting payments.</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTH 1 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 6 PAYMENT </th>
<th> MONTH 12 PAYMENT </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>          110.34 </td>
<td>           131.72 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           65.58 </td>
<td>            55.30 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>           80.00 </td>
<td>           64.08 </td>
<td>            52.98 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>          240.00 </td>
<td>           240.00 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
What we&rsquo;re going to do here is focus on making the largest payment on the highest
interest card while paying the minimum on the remainder. If you recall Card A had the highest
interest rate with 29%.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>        </th>
<th> MONTHS TO PAY OFF </th>
<th> INTEREST </th>
<th> TOTAL PAID </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Card A </td>
<td>                22 </td>
<td>   600.85 </td>
<td>   2,600.85 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card B </td>
<td>                28 </td>
<td>   428.39 </td>
<td>   2,428.39 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Card C </td>
<td>                32 </td>
<td>   341.44 </td>
<td>   2,341.44 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Total  </td>
<td>                32 </td>
<td> 1,370.68 </td>
<td>   7,621.94 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><br/>
By adjusting our payments we have paid our debt off 6 months faster than the previous
method and saved an additional $251.26.</p>

<p>To recap, this method of adjusting our payments took us from 137 months to 32 months and
saved us 2,332.16 in interest.</p>

<p>See if you can apply this principle to your finances and you&rsquo;ll free up considerable money
fast.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-17T19:33:19-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/17/how-to-stay-poor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following are some ideas regarding social economic classes and spending patterns
introduced in various books such as <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/poor_a.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Here we see the typical young person or the poor. The income on the left
being consumed almost completely by basic recurring expenses.
The net or left over income is very little.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/middle_class_a.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>As the individual begins to earn more income his economic status improves and
his net income grows since he is now outpacing his recurring expenses. Life is
good, he can afford things he could not before. He can now qualify for credit
and loans given this higher income bracket. However, he then falls into the trap
middle class america falls into&hellip;debt.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/middle_class_b.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>He begins to engage in financial commitments that generate a
recurring bill such as buying a home, leasing a car, loans, credit card
purchases, etc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/middle_class_c.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>These long term commitments now generate a recurring bill which consumes his
monthly net income, lowering its margin and causing him to be broke&hellip;again.</p>

<p>I hate to use the term &ldquo;rich&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a little banal and sometimes not
accurate of this class of individual. Let&rsquo;s just call him the &lsquo;well off&rsquo;. This is one prudent strategy
to build solvency and build economic independence.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/middle_class_to_rich_b.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Here the person, instead of investing in future financial commitments, tackles
existing commitment to pay them down or off and then invests in income generating
assets. Preferably assets that passively generate income. In other words assets that
will generate income and not consume much of his time. Things like royality rights,
stocks, bonds, intellectual property, real estate and such.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/middle_class_to_rich_c.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>By doing this he now lowers his recurring debt increasing his net income. Also he
begins earning money passively thus boosting his current income.</p>

<p>I hope this might be useful to some you. Feel free to drop some comments or questions below. And if you liked it then

<p>The Paleo Diet is an effort to eat as our prehistoric ancestors did prior to the
advent of farming. Food such as meats, fish, nuts, leafy greens, veggies, and seeds
are foods typically found on the diet.</p>

<p>One of the things I believe is missing from the diet is the eating pattern our
ancestors practiced. You see there were typically periods of feast and famine.
After a successful hunt the group would feast. Then one might expect a certain amount
of time would pass before another successful hunt would take place and thus a
time of fasting would occur.</p>

<p>The dietary practice of intermittent fasting attempts to implement in some form this type of
eating pattern. Generally the diet limits eating to an 8 hour window with a 16 hour
fast in between.</p>

a strong proponent of this diet and has achieved remarkable results practicing it.

<h3>Myth: Eating frequent small meals helps you loose weight</h3>

<p>An extenisve review of various meal frequencies and its effect on metabolism
showed no effect between eating several small meals or a couple of large ones.</p>

<p>To quote the review, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494">&ldquo;More importantly, studies using
whole-body calorimetry and doubly-labelled water to assess total 24 h
energy expenditure find <strong>no difference between nibbling and gorging.</strong>&rdquo;</a></p>

<h3>Myth: Eat smaller meals more often for hunger control.</h3>

<p>Current research suggests the opposite. Eating more often leads to increased
hunger.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20339363">&ldquo;Collectively, these data suggest that higher protein
intake promotes satiety and challenge the concept that
increasing the number of eating occasions enhances satiety
in overweight and obese men&rdquo;</a></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The following are some examples of the form this pattern of feeding and exercise would
look like:</p>

<h4>Pattern 1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fasting - Fast from 8 p.m. the night before till 10 -11 a.m. or so and take 10g BCAAs.</li>
<li>Train - Hot the gym and get your workout in.</li>
<li>Meal One – 1 p.m.</li>
<li>Meal Two – 4 p.m.</li>
<li>Meal Three – 7 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pattern 2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pre-Workout Meal - 12 Noon.</li>
<li>Train</li>
<li>Meal Two – 4 p.m.</li>
<li>Meal Three – 7/8 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Pattern 3</h4>

<ul>
<li>Meal One – Noon.</li>
<li>Meal Two – 3 p.m.</li>
<li>Train</li>
<li>Meal Three – 7/8 p.m.</li>
</ul>


<p>Martin Berkhan claims many benefits to this type of dieting such as weight loss,
better hormonal response and improved blood sugar levels. He cites various
scientific studies and testimonials from his clients.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/14/from-passion-to-income/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-14T20:46:52-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/14/from-passion-to-income</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.</p><footer><strong>Confucius</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>One of my recent reads is the book <em>&lsquo;The $100 Startup&rsquo;</em>.
It&rsquo;s inspiring and full of great advice
on starting a business on shoe string budget. The author
has done a great deal of research finding people followed their dreams made
it as well as how they did it.</p>

<p>One of the ideas covered in the book is called <em>&lsquo;Convergence&rsquo;</em>. This
occurs when a person able to generate income from the thing or things he
is passionate about.</p>

<p>While there are many ways to make money, I would say most would either be boring or
life draining. Being stuck in a job or career that brings you no joy is
just grueling and painful. That&rsquo;s where the daily grind of 8 to 5 will just burn you
out after a few years.</p>

<p>On the other side is being passionate about things which bring you no income. While I may love
walks in the park, I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever make much money at it.</p>

<p>However, don&rsquo;t be too quick to quit on that crazy idea. It often
just takes a little creativity to pull it off.
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-youtube-stars-2014-3#19-theradbrad-2">Bradley &ldquo;The Rad Brad&rdquo; Colburn</a>, for example,
makes between $137 thousand - $1.38 million dollars a year doing humorous video game &lsquo;walkthroughs&rsquo; on YouTube.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/convergence.jpg" width="592" height="420"></p>

<p>Here are the steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. List out the things you love to do and are passionate about.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Figure out which are likely to make you income.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Do that.</p>

<p>I did something similar in the summer of 1999. After working at several unsatisfying odd jobs
over the years, I realized I needed good income and fulfilling work. I had no formal education but
a lot of interest in various things. I was a good artist but I figured there was no decent income
in that and the demand didn&rsquo;t seem high for it at the time. I did like computers and had above
average knowledge so I thought, &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll try that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I bought various computer science books, studied in the evenings and landed a job in
tech support about 6 months later. From there, I continued studying,
was promoted to the software development department. I attended
several classes at a couple of local 2 year colleges.</p>

<p>To this day I continue expanding my skill set, looking at what&rsquo;s in demand and doing that. I&rsquo;ve
greatly expanded my income and I love what I do. You can do it too.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/03/5-low-carb-oatmeal-recipes/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-03T14:30:56-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/03/5-low-carb-oatmeal-recipes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before going low carb, I used to enjoy the occasional bowl of oatmeal.
Depending on the type of low carb diet you practice and how strict
the amount of carbs are, it may not be a choice. A typical serving
comes in at 20 plus or so net carbs. This prompted me to take a look
around the inter webs and look some low carb alternatives.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/Grain-Free-Instant-Cinnamon-Oatmeal.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>This first recipe uses chai seeds, flax meal, shredded unsweetened
coconut and cinnamon. Add some hot water, a bit of unsweetened
coconut milk, sweetener  and you might have a <a href="http://holisticallyengineered.com/2013/05/instant-cinnamon-oatmeal-low-carb.html">winner</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/low-carb-overnight-flax-meal-1-704x1024.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>This next recipe is called ‘Overnight Flaxmeal’.
It incorporates yogurt, flaxseed meal, unsweetened almond milk,
protein powder, sweetener and raspberries.
It’s a simple recipe and the
<a href="http://the-lowcarb-diet.com/low-carb-overnight-flax-meal">instructions</a>
are pretty straight forward.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/coconut_oatmeal.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Another showing some promise is ‘Coconut Breakfast Porridge’.
<a href="http://freshfitnhealthy.com/2014/04/coconut-breakfast-porridge-low-carb-oatmeal">This recipe</a> uses unsweetened shredded coconut,  unsweetened
vanilla almond milk, Coconut Flour.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/noatmeal-finished.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>This <a href="http://delishix.com/noatmeal-no-oatmeal-recipe">one</a> is a
bit trickier since you have to grind up various nuts
in a food processor and you’ll have to incorporate eggs into as well.
The ingredients in this recipe are walnuts, pecans, almonds, pepitas,
flax meal, cinnamon, almond butter, eggs, sweetener.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/low_carb_coconut_oatmeal.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>This final one is very simple straightforward
<a href="http://www.foodiefiasco.com/low-carb-coconut-oatmeal">recipe</a>
with minimal ingredient. The items needed are coconut,
coconut milk, water and coconut flour.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/02/chocolate-ganache-recipe/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-02T15:13:50-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/02/chocolate-ganache-recipe</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ganache is a chocolate mixture used in several deserts. Warm ganache can be lightly poured on cake to create a glaze or it can be used as filling in cakes such as a molten lava cake. It can also drizzled on ice cream as tasty topping. Cold ganache can be rolled into chocolate truffles.</p>

<p>My current favorite low carb sweetener I use in cooking is Sin-Free Sugar. It has a flavor very close to sugar, is all natural and calorie free. I prefer it to Truvia for various reasons. Truvia consists of erythritol, stevia and natural flavors. I notice when using Truvia in recipes that require a lot sweetener that it tends to become gritty upon cooling. I don’t run into this issue with Sin-Free since it consists of a blend of natural sugars your body does not absorb. For more information you can check out the Sin-Free Sugar website: <a href="https://www.sinfreesugar.com/">https://www.sinfreesugar.com/</a> .</p>

<p>The mixture will thicken to harden in the fridge. You can gently melt some in the microwave when you want to use it on your low carb deserts or you an add some to your coffee with a bit of cream for a real tasty coffee mocha.</p>

<p>The recipes yields about 29 oz with under 1 net carb for 2 oz serving.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/images/ganache_smaller.jpg" width="300"></p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
<li>8 oz unsweetened chocolate</li>
<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
<li>2 cups of Sin-Free Sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons SweetLeaf</li>
<li>4 tablespoons salted butter</li>
</ul>


<h4>Steps:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Chop unsweetened chocolate and butter, place into a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Mix dry ingredients together (Sin-Free Sugar, SweetLeaf) and place into a medium saucepan.</li>
<li>Add wet ingredients (heavy cream, vanilla) to saucepan, Stir until dry and wet ingredients are mixed well so that no large lumps are present.</li>
<li>Heat the mixture while stirring. When mixture bubbles and begins to climb the sides of the saucepan, turn off stove and remove from heat.</li>
<li>Add hot mixture to mixing bowl containing chocolate pieces and wait 1 minute.</li>
<li>Stir mixture in bowl until all chocolate is melted and well incorporated.</li>
<li>Whisk until smooth and slightly thickened.</li>
<li>Leave until a bit cooled and then move to a container and store in refrigerator.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/02/o2-trainer/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-02T15:03:45-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/02/o2-trainer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently received the O2 Trainer as a present this past Christmas.
The idea of this product is to strengthen your diaphragm and lung muscles via resistance as you pull air into your lungs.
It consists of a mouth piece and interchangeable modules which provide 14 stages of resistance.
If you visit www.o2trainer.com you find various studies using the product, testimonials and instructions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
   O2 Trainer
</p>


<p>My purpose for the product is improving athletic performance.
I&rsquo;m currently a blue belt in Kenpo Karate, a style which utilizes quick hand strikes and kicks.
Sparring can be quite intense and can quickly cause one to run out of breath.
Tonight I started the first breathing exercise. Starting with module number 11, I did 4 sets of 12 reps.
One breathes in hard and then exhales. Once I was done and for a few hours after, I could feel that my diagram and abs got a good workout.
I look forward to continued use of this product and effect it has on my performance.</p>
