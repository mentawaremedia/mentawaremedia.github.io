<p>Some months ago I came across a list of top books recommended by
successful entrepreneurs. Towards the top of this list was the
book &lsquo;The Lean Startup&rsquo;. I highly recommend this book to anyone
looking to start their own business or anyone involved in management.</p>

<p>One of the major concepts in the lean startup method is what&rsquo;s referred to
as the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. The basic idea is a cycle of
of building a product, measuring success then learning from this measurement
and other actions so as to build a better product and finally start
the cycle again. It is a way managing uncertainty and risk.</p>

<p>Realize that it&rsquo;s the speed at which this cycle occurs that most likely
determines success. A startup or new venture has a limited amount of time
and/or funds in order to become a viable concern. Once these resources are
consumed and no other options are present; the startup is done. This is why
speed is of essence.</p>

<p>While the cycle seems straight forward, each of these points on the cycle
has it&rsquo;s challenges.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The Lean Startup has the concept of a Minimal Viable Product or MVP.
The idea is that you never build more than what is needed to learn.
While we would all love to produce a beautiful finished and polished
piece of work, it comes at a price. The price is time and waste.</p>

<p>What benefit is it to create a &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; product that no one will ever buy?
The end result is a tremendous investment in time with the end result of
learning that no one wants it. One could have learned this in a fraction
of the time and expense with an MVP.</p>

<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>Learn to measure and track meaningful things that will guide you in determining
if your product is proving successful. The book covers in detail the difference
between actionable metrics and vanity metrics. In order for a metric to be
actionable it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Otherwise the metric
could lead you astray giving you a false sense of security.</p>

<h2>Learn</h2>

<p>Are you taking what you&rsquo;ve learned from your metrics to build an even better
product or are you randomly dropping in product features and strategies simply
because it &lsquo;feels right&rsquo; or it sounds like a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;? At what point do
you make a fundamental change to your business based on the learning done
so far? What have we learned and what are we doing about it?</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little article.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been sticking to a pattern that has worked well
for me for releasing new blog content. On Mondays I&rsquo;ll post an article on self
improvement or health related topic. Wednesday I&rsquo;ll release an article for
folks doing software development and Fridays I&rsquo;ll close out the week with
something fun such as some interesting Youtube videos. Thanks to all my
return visitors. I hope you come back soon.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-05T17:51:33-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/05/the-pareto-principle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a very powerful principle and it can be quite
transformative if you can learn to spot it and apply it to your daily life.
I first became aware of the Pareto Principle when I worked as a
developer at a company in the business of selling software to mid-level
manufacturing companies.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/pareto-principle.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>The Pareto Principle goes by many names such the 80/20 principle, Pareto&rsquo;s
Law, the law of the vital few and more. What it basically states is that
20% of the causes drive 80% of the effects. Another way of saying this is
that 20% of the inputs results in 80% of the outputs. For example a company
will likely find that 20% of their customers generate 80% of their income.</p>

<p>Microsoft found that fixing the top 20% of the most reported bugs eliminated
80% of the related errors and crashes in a given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">system</a>.
Other observations have included things such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>20% of motorists cause 80% of traffic accidents</li>
<li>20% of criminals account for 80% of the value of all crime</li>
<li>20% of the clothes a person person owns is worn 80% of the time.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was recently reintroduced to the principle upon reading Tim Ferriss&#8217; book,
The 4-hour Workweek. He drives home the idea of eliminating waste through its
use and this is one way the principle can be transformative.</p>

<p>If a company realizes that 80% of it&rsquo;s time is consumed by 20% of its customers
then it must ask itself the hard question, &ldquo;Should we part ways with those clients.&rdquo;
If those clients are contribiting only a small amount of the revenue but
are capitalizing most of the time then indeed parting ways maybe the smart choice.</p>

<p>We may find in our own daily lives that 20% of our activities consume
80% of our time. These activities could consist of web surfing, answering
emails, and other unproductive activities. Should we remove or greatly
limit these activities then we could recoop signifact chunks of time
as well as reduce our stress.</p>

<p>Give it some thought and see if this principle can be applied to an area
of your life, activity or business.</p>

    <link href="http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/17/how-to-stay-poor/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-17T19:33:19-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/02/17/how-to-stay-poor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following are some ideas regarding social economic classes and spending patterns
introduced in various books such as <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/poor_a.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Here we see the typical young person or the poor. The income on the left
being consumed almost completely by basic recurring expenses.
The net or left over income is very little.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_a.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>As the individual begins to earn more income his economic status improves and
his net income grows since he is now outpacing his recurring expenses. Life is
good, he can afford things he could not before. He can now qualify for credit
and loans given this higher income bracket. However, he then falls into the trap
middle class america falls into&hellip;debt.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_b.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>He begins to engage in financial commitments that generate a
recurring bill such as buying a home, leasing a car, loans, credit card
purchases, etc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_c.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>These long term commitments now generate a recurring bill which consumes his
monthly net income, lowering its margin and causing him to be broke&hellip;again.</p>

<p>I hate to use the term &ldquo;rich&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a little banal and sometimes not
accurate of this class of individual. Let&rsquo;s just call him the &lsquo;well off&rsquo;. This is one prudent strategy
to build solvency and build economic independence.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_to_rich_b.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>Here the person, instead of investing in future financial commitments, tackles
existing commitment to pay them down or off and then invests in income generating
assets. Preferably assets that passively generate income. In other words assets that
will generate income and not consume much of his time. Things like royality rights,
stocks, bonds, intellectual property, real estate and such.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/middle_class_to_rich_c.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>By doing this he now lowers his recurring debt increasing his net income. Also he
begins earning money passively thus boosting his current income.</p>
