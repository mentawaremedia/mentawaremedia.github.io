<p>Some months ago I came across a list of top books recommended by
successful entrepreneurs. Towards the top of this list was the
book &lsquo;The Lean Startup&rsquo;. I highly recommend this book to anyone
looking to start their own business or anyone involved in management.</p>

<p>One of the major concepts in the lean startup method is what&rsquo;s referred to
as the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. The basic idea is a cycle of
of building a product, measuring success then learning from this measurement
and other actions so as to build a better product and finally start
the cycle again. It is a way managing uncertainty and risk.</p>

<p>Realize that it&rsquo;s the speed at which this cycle occurs that most likely
determines success. A startup or new venture has a limited amount of time
and/or funds in order to become a viable concern. Once these resources are
consumed and no other options are present; the startup is done. This is why
speed is of essence.</p>

<p>While the cycle seems straight forward, each of these points on the cycle
has it&rsquo;s challenges.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The Lean Startup has the concept of a Minimal Viable Product or MVP.
The idea is that you never build more than what is needed to learn.
While we would all love to produce a beautiful finished and polished
piece of work, it comes at a price. The price is time and waste.</p>

<p>What benefit is it to create a &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; product that no one will ever buy?
The end result is a tremendous investment in time with the end result of
learning that no one wants it. One could have learned this in the fraction
of the time and expense with an MVP.</p>

<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>Learn to measure and track meaningful things that will guide you in determining
if your product is proving successful. The book covers in detail the difference
between actionable metrics and vanity metrics. In order for a metric to be
actionable it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Otherwise the metric
could lead you astray giving you a false sense of security.</p>

<h2>Learn</h2>

<p>Are you taking what you&rsquo;ve learned from your metrics to build an even better
product or are you randomly dropping in product features and strategies simply
because it &lsquo;feels right&rsquo; or it sounds like a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;? At what point do
you make a fundamental change to you business based on the learning you done
so far? What have we learned and what are we doing about it?</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little article.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been sticking to a pattern that has worked well
for me for releasing new blog content. On Mondays I&rsquo;ll post an article on self
improvement or health related topic. Wednesday I&rsquo;ll release an article for
folks doing software development and Fridays I&rsquo;ll close out the week with
something fun such as some interesting Youtube videos. Thanks to all my
return visitors. I hope you come back soon.</p>

    <id>http://www.verygoodindicators.com/blog/2015/04/05/the-pareto-principle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a very powerful principle and it can be quite
transformative if you can learn to spot it and apply it to your daily life.
I first became aware of the Pareto Principle when I worked as a
developer at a company in the business of selling software to mid-level
manufacturing companies.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/pareto-principle.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>The Pareto Principle goes by many names such the 80/20 principle, Pareto&rsquo;s
Law, the law of the vital few and more. What it basically states is that
20% of the causes drive 80% of the effects. Another way of saying this is
that 20% of the inputs results in 80% of the outputs. For example a company
will likely find that 20% of their customers generate 80% of their income.</p>

<p>Microsoft found that fixing the top 20% of the most reported bugs eliminated
80% of the related errors and crashes in a given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">system</a>.
Other observations have included things such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>20% of motorists cause 80% of traffic accidents</li>
<li>20% of criminals account for 80% of the value of all crime</li>
<li>20% of the clothes a person person owns is worn 80% of the time.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was recently reintroduced to the principle upon reading Tim Ferriss&#8217; book,
The 4-hour Workweek. He drives home the idea of eliminating waste through its
use and this is one way the principle can be transformative.</p>

<p>If a company realizes that 80% of it&rsquo;s time is consumed by 20% of its customers
then it must ask itself the hard question, &ldquo;Should we part ways with those clients.&rdquo;
If those clients are contribiting only a small amount of the revenue but
are capitalizing most of the time then indeed parting ways maybe the smart choice.</p>

<p>We may find in our own daily lives that 20% of our activities consume
80% of our time. These activities could consist of web surfing, answering
emails, and other unproductive activities. Should we remove or greatly
limit these activities then we could recoop signifact chunks of time
as well as reduce our stress.</p>

<p>Give it some thought and see if this principle can be applied to an area
of your life, activity or business.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently received the O2 Trainer as a present this past Christmas.
The idea of this product is to strengthen your diaphragm and lung muscles via resistance as you pull air into your lungs.
It consists of a mouth piece and interchangeable modules which provide 14 stages of resistance.
If you visit www.o2trainer.com you find various studies using the product, testimonials and instructions.</p>

   O2 Trainer
</p>


<p>My purpose for the product is improving athletic performance.
I&rsquo;m currently a blue belt in Kenpo Karate, a style which utilizes quick hand strikes and kicks.
Sparring can be quite intense and can quickly cause one to run out of breath.
Tonight I started the first breathing exercise. Starting with module number 11, I did 4 sets of 12 reps.
One breathes in hard and then exhales. Once I was done and for a few hours after, I could feel that my diagram and abs got a good workout.
I look forward to continued use of this product and effect it has on my performance.</p>
